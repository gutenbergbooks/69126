<span class="smcap">Tho. Brown</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Had done myself the honour to write to you long ago, but wanted a
convenience of sending my letter; for you must not imagine â€™tis as easy
a matter for us on this side the river <i>Styx</i>, to maintain a
correspondence with you in the upper world, as â€™tis to send a pacquet
from <i>London</i> to <i>Rotterdam</i>, or from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Madrid</i>: But upon the
news of a fresh war ready to break out in your part of the world,
(which, by the by, makes us keep holy-day here in hell) <i>Pluto</i> having
thought fit to dispatch an extraordinary messenger to see how your
parliament, upon whose resolutions the fate of <i>Europe</i> seems wholly to
depend, will behave themselves in this critical<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span> conjuncture. I tippâ€™d
the fellow a George to carry this letter for me, and leave it with the
master at <i>Will</i>â€™s in his way to <i>Westminster</i>.</p>

<p>I am not insensible, gentlemen, that <i>Homer</i>, <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Dante</i>, Don
<i>Quevedo</i>, and many more before me, have given an account of these
subterranean dominions, for which reason it may look like affectation or
vanity in me to meddle with a subject so often handled; but if new
travels into <i>Italy</i>, <i>Spain</i> and <i>Germany</i>, are daily read with
approbation, because new matters of enquiry and observation perpetually
arise, I donâ€™t see why the present state of the <i>Plutonian</i> kingdoms may
not be acceptable, there having been as great changes and alterations in
these infernal regions, as in any other part of the universe whatever.</p>

<p>When I shook hands with your upper hemisphere, I stumbled into a dark,
uncouth, dismal lane, which, if it be lawful to compare great things
with small, somewhat resembles that dusky dark cut under the mountains
called the <i>grotto</i> of <i>Puzzoli</i> in the way to <i>Naples</i>. I was in so
great a consternation, that I donâ€™t remember exactly how long it was,
but this I remember full well, that there were a world of ditches on
both sides of the wall, adorned and furnished with harpies, gorgons,
centaurs, chimeras, and such like pretty curiosities, which could not
but give a man a world of titillation as he traveled on the road. The
three-headed <i>Gerion</i>, put me in mind of the master of the <i>Temple</i>â€™s
three intellectual minds, and when I saw <i>Briares</i> with his hundred arms
and hands, out of my zeal to king <i>William</i> and his government, I could
not but wish that we had so well qualifyâ€™d a person for secretary of
state ever since the Revolution; for having so many heads and hands to
employ, he might easily have managed all affairs domestick and foreign,
and been both dictator and clerk to himself. Which besides the advantage
of keeping secret all orders and instructions, (and that you know,
gentlemen, is of no small importance in politicks) would have saved his
majesty no inconsiderable sum in his civil list.</p>

<p>Being arrived at the end of this doleful and execrable lane, I came into
a large open, barren plain, throâ€™ which ran a river, whose water was as
black as my hat: Coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span> to the banks of this wonderful river, an old
ill-lookâ€™d wrinklâ€™d fellow in a tatterâ€™d boat, which did not seem to be
worth a groat, making towards the shoar, beckonâ€™d, and held out his
right-hand to me: Knowing nothing of his business or character, I could
not imagine what he meant by doing so; but upon second thoughts,
thinking he had a mind to have his fortune told, <i>You must understand,
old gentleman</i>, says I to him, <i>that there are three principal lines in
a manâ€™s hand, the first of which is called by the learned</i> Ludovicus
Vives, <i>Secretary to</i> Tamerlain <i>the magnificent, the</i> linea boetica,
<i>line of life; the second, the</i> linea hepatica, <i>or liver line; the
third and last, the</i> linea intercalaris, <i>so callâ€™d by</i> Sebastian
Munster <i>and</i> Erra Pater, <i>because it crosses the two aforesaid lines in
an equicrural parabola</i>. Hold your impertinent stuff, says the old
ferryman, <i>erra</i> me no <i>erra paters</i>, but speak to the point, and give
me my fare, if you design to come over. By this I perceivâ€™d my mistake,
and knew him to be <i>Charon</i>: So I dived into my pockets, but alas! I
found all the birds were flown, if ever any had been there, which you
may believe, gentlemen, was no small mortification to me. Get you gone
for a rascally scoundrel as you are, says <i>Charon</i>, some son of whore of
a fiddler, or player, I warrant you; go and take up your quarters with
those pennyless rogues that are sunning themselves on yonder hillock. To
see now how a man may be mistaken by a fair outside! when I came up to
â€™em, I found them a parcel of jolly well-lookâ€™d fellows, who, one would
have thought were wealthy enough to have fined for sheriffs: I counted,
let me see, six princes of the empire that were younger brothers, ten
<i>French</i> counts, fourteen knights of <i>Malta</i>, twelve <i>Welsh</i> gentlemen,
sixteen <i>Scotch</i> lairds, with abundance of chymists, projectors,
insurers, noblemens creditors, and the like; that were all wind-bound
for want of the ready <i>rhino</i>. Two days we continued in this doleful
condition; and as Dr. <i>Sherlock</i> says of himself, in relation to the
13th chapter of the <i>Romans</i>, <i>here I stuck, and had stuck till the last
conflagration, if it had not been for bishop</i> Overall<i>â€™s
Convocation-Book</i>; eâ€™en so here we might have tarryâ€™d world without end,
if an honest teller of the <i>Exchequer</i>, and a clerk of the <i>pay-office</i>,
had not come to our relief; who understanding our case, cryâ€™d out,
<i>Come<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span> along, gentlemen, we have money enough to defray twenty such
trifles as this; God be praisâ€™d, we had the good luck to die before the
parliament looked into our accounts</i>. With that they gave <i>Charon</i> a
broad-piece each of â€™em, so our whole caravan consisting of about 70
persons in all, that had not a farthing in the world to bless
themselves, ferryâ€™d over to the other side of the river.</p>

<p>As we were crossing the stream, <i>Charon</i> told us how an <i>Irish</i> captain
would have trickâ€™d him. He came strutting down to the river-side, says
he, as fine as a prince, in a long scarlet cloak, all bedaubâ€™d with
silver lace, but had not a penny about him. <i>Dear joy</i>, crys he to me,
<i>I came away in a little haste from the other world, and left my
breeches behind me, but Iâ€™ll make thee amends by Chreest and St.</i>
Patrick, <i>for Iâ€™ll refresh thy antient nostrils with some of</i>
Hippolito<i>â€™s best snuff, which cost me a week ago, a crown an ounce</i>. I
told the <i>Hibernian</i>, that old birds were not to be taken with chaff,
nor <i>Charon</i> to be banterâ€™d out of his due with a little dust of
sot-weed; and giving him a reprimand with my stretcher over the noddle,
bid him go, like a coxcomb as he was, about his business. The wretch
santerâ€™d about the banks for a month, but at last, pretended to be a
<i>Frenchman</i>, got over gratis this summer, among the duke of <i>Orlean</i>â€™s
retinue. But what was the most surprizing piece of news I ever heard,
<i>Charon</i> assured us, upon his veracity, that the late king of <i>Spain</i>
was forcâ€™d to lie by full a fortnight, for want of money to carry him
over; for cardinal <i>Portocarero</i> had been so busy in forging his will,
that he had forgot to leave the poor monarch a farthing in his pocket;
and that at last, one of his own grandees, coming by that way, was so
complaisant as to defray his princeâ€™s passage; and well he might, says
our surly ferryman, for in five years time he had cheated him of two
millions.</p>

<p>We were no sooner landed on the other side of the river, but some of us
filâ€™d off to the right, and others to the left, as their business called
them: For my part, I made the best of my way to the famous city
<i>Brandinopolis</i>, seated upon the river <i>Phlegethon</i>, as being a place of
the greatest commerce and resort in all king <i>Pluto</i>â€™s dominions. Who
should I meet upon the road but my old friend said acquaintance Mr.
<i>Nokes</i>, the comedian, who received<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_5">{5}</a></span> me with all imaginable love and
affection? Mr. <i>Haines</i>, says he, <i>I am glad with all my heart to see
you in Hell</i>; upon my salvation, we have expected you here this great
while, and I question not but our royal master will give you a reception
befitting a person of your extraordinary merit. Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, said I,
<i>Your most obedient servant</i>, you are pleasâ€™d to compliment, but I know
no other merit I have, but that of being honourâ€™d with your friendship.
<i>But my dear</i> Jo., cries he, <i>how go affairs in Covent-Garden?</i> Does
cuckoldom flourish, and fornication maintain its ground still against
the reformers? And the play-house in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, is it as much
frequented as it usâ€™d to be? I had no sooner given him a satisfactory
answer to these questions, but we found ourselves in the suburbs; so my
friend <i>Nokes</i>, with that gaity and openness, which became him so well
at the play-house, <i>Jo.</i>, says he, Iâ€™ll give thee thy welcome to Hell;
with that he carryâ€™d me to a little blind coffee-house, in the middle of
a dirty alley, but certainly one of the worst furnishâ€™d tenements I ever
beheld: there was nothing to be seen but a few broken pipes, two or
three founderâ€™d chairs, and bare naked walls, with not so much as a
superannuated almanack, or tatterâ€™d ballad to keep â€™em in countenance;
so that I could not but fancy myself in some of loveâ€™s little
tabernacles about <i>Wildstreet</i>, or <i>Drury-Lane</i>. Come, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, and
what are you disposed to drink? What you please, Sir. Here, madam, give
the gentleman a glass of <i>Geneva</i>. As soon as I had whippâ€™d it down, my
friend <i>Nokes</i> plucking me by the sleeve, and whispering me in the ear,
prithee <i>Jo.</i>, who dost think that lady at the bar is? I considerâ€™d her
very attentively, by the same token she was three times as ugly as my
lady <i>Frightall</i>, countess of &#8212;&#8212; and three times as thick and bulky as
Mrs. <i>Pix</i> the poetress, and very fairly told him, I knew her not. Why
then I shall surprize you. This is the famous <i>Semiramis</i>. The Devil she
is! answerâ€™d I: What is this the celebrated and renowned queen of
<i>Babylon</i>, she that built those stupendious walls and pensile gardens,
of which antient historians tell us so many miracles; that victorious
<i>heroine</i>, who eclipsed the triumphs of her illustrious husband; that
added <i>Ã†thiopia</i> to her empire; and was the wonder as well as the
ornament of her sex? Is it possible she should<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_6">{6}</a></span> fall so low as to be
forced to sell <i>Geneva</i>, and such ungodly liquors for a subsistence?
â€™Tis eâ€™en so, says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, and this may serve as a lesson of
instruction to you, that when once death has laid his icy paws upon us,
all other distinctions of fortune and quality immediately vanish. These
words were no sooner out of his mouth, but in came a formal old
gentleman, and plucking a large wooden box from under his cloak, <i>Will
you have any fine snuff</i>, gentlemen, <i>here is the finest snuff in the
universe</i>, gentlemen; <i>a never failing remedy</i>, gentlemen, <i>against the
megrims and head-ach</i>. And who do you take this worthy person to be?
says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, But that I am in this lower world, cryâ€™d I, I durst
swear â€™tis the very individual quaker that sells his herb-snuff at the
<i>Rainbow</i> coffee-house. Damnably mistaken, says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, before
<i>George</i>, no less a man than the great <i>Cyrus</i>, the first founder of the
<i>Persian</i> monarchy. I was going to bless myself at this discovery, when
a jolly red-nosâ€™d woman in a straw-hat popt into the room, and in a
shrill treble cryâ€™d out, <i>Any buckles, combs or scissars</i>, gentlemen,
<i>and tooth-picks, bottle-screws or twizers, silver buttons or
tobacco-stoppers</i>, gentlemen; well now, my worthy friend, Mr. <i>Haines</i>,
who do you think this to be? The Lord knows, replyâ€™d I, for here are
such an unaccountable choppings and changings among you that the Devil
canâ€™t tell what to make of â€™em. Why then, in short, this is the virtuous
<i>Thalestris</i>, Queen of the <i>Amazons</i>, the same numerical princess, that
beat the hoof so many hundred leagues to get <i>Alexander</i> the Great to
administer his royal nipple to her. But <i>Jo.</i> since I find thee so
affected at these alterations that have happenâ€™d to persons who lived so
many hundred years ago, I am resolvâ€™d to shew thee some of a more modern
date, and particularly of such as either thou wast acquainted with in
the other world, or at lead hast often heard mentionâ€™d in company. So
calling for the other glass of <i>Geneva</i>, he left a tester at the bar,
and <i>Semiramis</i>, to shew her courtly breeding, droppâ€™d us abundance of
curtesies, and paid us as much respect at our coming out, as your
two-penny <i>French</i> barbers in <i>Soho</i> do to a gentleman that gives them a
brace of odd half-pence above the original contract in their sign.</p>

<p>We walkâ€™d throâ€™ half a dozen streets without meeting any thing worthy of
observation. At last my friend <i>Nokes</i>, pointed to a little edifice,
which exactly resembles Dr. <i>Burgess</i>â€™s conventicle in <i>Russel-Court</i>;
says he, your old acquaintance <i>Tony Lee</i>, who turnâ€™d presbyterian
parson, upon his coming into these quarters, holds forth most notably
here every <i>Sunday</i>; <i>Jacob Hall</i> and <i>Jevon</i> are his clerks, and chant
it admirably. Mother <i>Stratford</i>, the duchess of <i>Mazarine</i>, my lord
<i>Warwick</i>, and Sir <i>Fleetwood</i>, are his constant hearers; and to
<i>Tony</i>â€™s everlasting honour be it spoken, he delivers his fire and
brimstone with so good a grace, splits his text so judiciously, turns up
the whites of his eyes so theologically, cuffs his cushion so
orthodoxly, and twirls his band-strings so primitively, that <i>Pluto</i> has
lately made him one of his chaplains in ordinary. From this we crossed
another street, which one may properly enough call the <i>Bow-street</i>, or
<i>Pall-Mall</i> of <i>Brandinopolis</i>. No sawcy tradesman or mechanick dares
presume to live here, but â€™tis wholly inhabited by fine gaudy fluttering
sparks, and fine airy ladies; who in no respect are inferior to yours in
<i>Covent-Garden</i>. When the sky is serene, and not a breath of wind
stirring, you may see whole covies of them displaying their finery in
the street; but at other times you never see â€™em our of a chair, for
fear of discomposing their commodes or periwigs. We had not gone twenty
paces, before we met three flaming beaux of the first magnitude, the
like of whom we never saw at the <i>Vourthoot</i> at the <i>Hague</i>, the
<i>Tuilleries</i> at <i>Paris</i>, or the <i>Mall</i> in St. <i>James</i>â€™s-park. They were
all three in black (for you must know we are in deep mourning here for
the death of my lady <i>Proserpine</i>â€™s favourite monkey) but he in the
middle, thoâ€™ he had neither face nor shape to qualify him for a gallant:
for he had a phyz as forbidden as beau <i>Whitaker</i>, and was as thick
about the waste, as the fat squab porter at the <i>Griffin</i>-tavern in
<i>Fullerâ€™s-Rents</i>, yet he made a most magnificent figure: His periwig was
large enough to have loaded a camel, and he had, bestowed upon it at
least a bushel of powder, I warrant you. His sword-knot dangled upon the
ground, and his steenkirk that was most agreeably discolourâ€™d with snuff
from top to bottom, reachâ€™d down to his waste; he carryâ€™d his hat under
his left-arm, walkâ€™d with both his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span> hands in the wastband of his
breeches, and his cane that hung negligently down in a string from his
right-arm, trailâ€™d most harmoniously against the pebbles, while the
master of it, tripping it nicely upon his toes, was humming to himself,</p>

<p class="nind">Having given you this description of him, I need not trouble myself to
enlarge upon the dress of his two companions, who, thoâ€™ they fell much
short of his inimitable original in point of garniture and dress, yet
they were singular enough to have drawn the eyes of men, women and
children after â€™em in any part of <i>Europe</i>. As I observed this sight
with a great deal of admiration, Mr. <i>Nokes</i> very gravely asked me, who
I took the middlemost person to be; upon my telling him I had never seen
him before, nor knew a syllable of him or his private history; why, says
Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, this is <i>Diogenes</i> the famous cynic philosopher, and his
two companions are <i>George Fox</i> and <i>James Naylor</i> the quakers.
<i>Diogenes</i>, replyâ€™d I to him, why he was one of the arrantest slovens in
all <i>Greece</i>, and a professâ€™d enemy to laundresses, for he never parted
with his shirt, â€™till his shirt parted with him. No matter for that,
says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, the case is alterâ€™d now with him, for he has the
vanity and affectation of twenty Sir <i>Courtly Nice</i>â€™s blended together;
he constantly dispatches a courier to <i>Lisbon</i> every month, to bring him
a cargo of <i>Limons</i> to wash his hands with; he sends to <i>Montpelier</i> for
<i>Hungary</i>-water; <i>Turin</i> furnishes him with <i>Rosa Solis</i>; <i>Nismes</i> with
<i>Eau de Conelle</i>, and <i>Paris</i> with <i>Ratifia</i> to settle his maw in the
morning. Nothing will go down with him but <i>Ortolans</i>, <i>Snipes</i>, and
<i>Woodcocks</i>; and <i>Matson</i>, that some years ago livâ€™d at the <i>Rummer</i> in
<i>Queen-street</i>, is the administrator of his kitchen. This, said I to
him, is the most phantastick change I have seen since my passing the
<i>Styx</i>: for who the plague wouâ€™d have believâ€™d that that antient quaker
<i>Diogenes</i>, and those modern cynicks, <i>Fox</i> and <i>Naylor</i>, should
degenerate so much from their primitive institution, as to set up for
fops? When we came up to â€™em, <i>Diogenes</i> gave us a most gracious bow,
but those<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_9">{9}</a></span> two everlasting complimenters, his friends, I was afraid
wouâ€™d have murderâ€™d me with their civilities; for which reason I
disingaged myself from â€™em something abruptly, by the same token I
overheard <i>James Naylor</i> call me <i>bougre insulare</i> and <i>tramontane</i>, for
my ill manners.</p>

<p>When the coast was clear of â€™em, says I to my <i>Nokes</i>, every thing is so
turned topsy-turvy here with you, that I can hardly resolve myself
whether I walk upon my head or my feet: right, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, says he,
but time is precious; so letâ€™s mend our pace if you please, that we may
see all the curiosities of this renowned city before â€™tis dark.</p>

<p>The next street we came into, we saw a tall thin-gutted mortal driving a
wheel-barrow of pears before him, and crying in a hoarse tone, <i>pears
twenty a penny</i>; looking him earnestly in the face, I presently knew him
to be beau <i>Heveiningham</i>, but I found he was shy, and so took no
further notice of him. Not ten doors from hence, says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, lives
poor <i>Norton</i>, that shot himself. I askâ€™d him in what quality, he
answered me, as a sub-operator to a disperser of darkness, <i>anglicÃ¨</i>, a
journeyman to a tallow-chandler. I would willingly have made him a short
visit, but was intercepted in my design by a brace of fellows that were
linkâ€™d to their good behaviour, like a pair of <i>Spanish</i> galley-slaves;
thoâ€™ they agreed as little as <i>Jowler</i> and <i>Ringwood</i> coupled together,
for one of â€™em luggâ€™d one away, and his brother the other. I soon knew
them to be <i>Dick Baldwin</i>, the whig-bookseller, and <i>Mason</i> the
non-swearing parson, whom, as I was afterwards informed, judge <i>Minos</i>,
had orderâ€™d to be yoakâ€™d thus, to be a mutual plague and punishment to
one another. Both of â€™em made up to us as hard as they could drive.
<i>Well, Sir, says the</i> Levite, <i>what comfortable news do you bring from
St.</i> Germains? <i>Our old friend</i> Lewis le Grand <i>is well I hope. Damn</i>
Lewis le Grand, <i>and all his adherents, cries</i> Dick Baldwin. <i>Pray Sir,
what racy touches of scandal have been publishâ€™d of late</i>, by my worthy
friends, <i>Sam. Johnson</i>, Mr. <i>Tutchin</i>, and honest Mr. <i>Atwood</i>; and the
gallows that groanâ€™d so long for <i>Robin Hog</i> the messenger, when is it
like to lose its longing? Have no fresh batteries attackâ€™d the court
lately from honest Mr. <i>Darby</i>â€™s in <i>Bartholomew-Close</i>? And prithee
what new piracies<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> from the quakers at the <i>Pump</i> in <i>Little-Britain</i>?
What new whales, devils, ghosts, murders; from <i>Wilkins</i> in the
<i>Fryars</i>? But above all, dear Sir, of what kidney are the present
sheriffs; and particularly my lord-mayor, how stands he affected? Why
<i>Dick</i>, says I to him, fearing to be stunnâ€™d with more interrogatories,
thoâ€™ most of the folks I have seen here are changed either for the
better or the worse, yet I find thou art the true, primitive, busy,
pragmatical, prating, muttering <i>Dick Baldwin</i> still, and will be so to
the end of the chapter. In the name of the three furies, what should
make thee trouble thyself about sheriffs and lord-mayor? But thou art of
the same foolish belief, I find, with thy brother coxcombs at <i>North</i>â€™s
coffee-house, who think all the fate of christendom depends upon the
choice of a lord-mayor; whereas to talk of things familiarly, and as we
ought to do, what is this two-leggâ€™d animal ycleped a lord-mayor, but a
certain temporary machine of the cityâ€™s setting up, who on certain
appointed days is obligâ€™d to ride on horse-back to please the
<i>Cheapside</i> wives, who must scuffle his way throâ€™ so many furlongs of
custard, who is only terrible to delinquent-bakers, oyster-women, and
scavengers; and has no other privilege above his brethren, as I know of,
but that of taking a comfortable nap in his gold chain at <i>Paul</i>â€™s or
<i>Salterâ€™s-Hall</i>; to either of which places his conscience, that is, his
interest, carries him. Surly <i>Dick</i> was going to say something in
defence of the city magistrate, but my brother <i>Nokes</i> and I prevented
him, by calling to the next hackney coachman, whom, to my great
surprise, I found to be the famous Dr. <i>Busby</i> of <i>Westminster</i>-school;
who now, instead of flogging boys, was content to act in an humbler
sphere, and exercise his lashing talent upon horses. We ordered him to
set us down at <i>Bedlam</i>, where my friend <i>Nokes</i> assured me we should
find diversion enough, and the first person we met with in this
celebrated mansion, was the famous queen <i>Dido</i> of <i>Carthage</i>, supported
by the ingenious Mrs. <i>Behn</i> on the one side, and the learned
<i>Christiana</i>, queen of <i>Sweden</i>, on the other. <i>Gentlemen</i>, cryâ€™d she,
<i>I conjure you, by that respect which is due to truth, and by that
complaisance which is owing to us of the fair sex, to believe none of
those idle lies that</i> Virgil <i>hath told of me. That impudent versifyer
has given out, that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span> murderâ€™d myself for the sake of his pious</i>
Trojan, <i>the hero of his romance; whereas I declare to you, gentlemen,
as I hope to be savâ€™d, that I never saw the face of that fugitive
scoundrel in my life, but dyâ€™d in my bed with as much decency and
resignation as any woman in the parish: but what touches my honour most
of all, is that most horrid calumny of my being all alone with</i> Ã†neas
<i>in the cave</i>. Upon this I humbly remonstrated to her majesty, that
althoâ€™ <i>Virgil</i> had taken the liberty to leave her and his pious
<i>Trojan</i> in a grotto together, yet he no where insinuated that any thing
criminal had passed between â€™em. How, says Mr. <i>Behn</i>, in a fury, was it
not scandal enough in all conscience, to say that a man and a woman were
in a dark blind cavern by themselves? What thoâ€™ there was no such
convenience as a bed or a couch in the room; nay, not so much as a
broken-backâ€™d chair, yet I desire you to tell me, sweet Mr. <i>Haines</i>,
what other business can a man and a woman have in the dark together,
but&#8212;&#8212;. Ay, cries the queen of <i>Sweden</i>, what other business can a man
and a woman have in the dark, but, as the fellow says in the <i>Moor of
Venice</i>, to make the beast with two backs? not to pick straws I hope, or
to tell tales of a tub. Under favour, ladies, replyâ€™d I, â€™tis impossible
I should think, for a grave sober man, and a woman of discretion, to
pass a few hours alone, without carrying matters so far home as you
insinuate. What in the dark? cries queen <i>Dido</i>, thatâ€™s mine a &#8212;&#8212; in a
band-box. Let peoples inclinations be never so modest and virtuous, yet
this cursed darkness puts the devil and all of wickedness into their
heads: the man will be pushing on his side, thatâ€™s certain; and as for
the woman, Iâ€™ll swear for her, that when no body can see her blush, she
will be consenting. In fine, thoâ€™ the soul be never so well fortifyâ€™d to
hold out a siege, yet the body, as soon as loveâ€™s artillery begins to
play upon it, it will soon beat a parley, and make a separate treaty for
itself.</p>

<p>Thus her <i>Punick</i> majesty ran on, and the Lord knows when her royal
clack would have done striking, if a female messenger had not come to
her in the nick of time, and whisperâ€™d her in the ear, to go to the
famous <i>Lucretia</i>â€™s crying-out, who, it seems, was got with child upon a
hay-cock, by <i>Ã†sop</i> the fabulist. As soon as queen<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span> <i>Dido</i> and her two
prattling companions were gone out of the room, Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, says I, you
have without question seen <i>Ã†sop</i> very often, therefore pray let me beg
the favour of you, to tell me whether he is such a deformed ill-favoured
wight, as the historians represent him; for you must know we have a
modern critick of singular humanity, near St. <i>James</i>â€™s, that has been
pleased, in some late dissertation upon <i>Phalaris</i>â€™s epistles, to
maintain that he was a well-shapâ€™d, handsome gentleman; and for a proof
of this, insists much upon <i>Ã†sop</i>â€™s intriguing with his fellow-slave,
the beautiful <i>Rhodope</i>. No, no, replies Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, <i>Ã†sop</i> is just
such a crumpled hump-shoulderâ€™d dog, for all the world, as you see him
before <i>Ogilby</i>â€™s translation of his fables; and let the above-mentioned
grammarian, I think they call him, Dr. <i>Bentivolio</i>, say what he will to
the contrary, â€™tis even so as I tell you. And now, we are upon the
chapter of Dr. <i>Bentivolio</i>; about a month ago I happenâ€™d to make merry
over a bowl of punch with <i>Phalaris</i> the <i>Sicilian</i> tyrant, who swore by
all that was good and sacred, that he would trounce the unmannerly slave
for robbing him of those epistles, which have gone unquestionâ€™d under
his name for so many ages: but the time is coming, said he, when I shall
make this impudent pedant cry <i>peccavi</i> for the unworthy treatment he
has given me: I have my brazen-bull, heaven be praisâ€™d, ready for him,
and as soon as he comes into these quarters, will shut him up in it, and
roast him with his own dull volumes, and those of his dearly beloved
friends the <i>Dutch</i> commentators.</p>

<p>By this time we were got to the upper end of the room, when, says Mr.
<i>Nokes</i> to me, I will shew you a most surprising sight. You must know
this place, like <i>Noah</i>â€™s ark, contains beasts of all sorts and sizes;
some have their brains turnâ€™d by politicks, who, except some three or
four that are sufferâ€™d to go abroad with a keeper, are lockâ€™d up in a
large apartment up stairs. These puppies rave eternally about liberty
and property, and the <i>jura populi</i>, and are so damnâ€™d mischievous, that
it is dangerous to venture near them. <i>England</i> sends more of this sort
to <i>Bedlam</i>, than all the countries of <i>Europe</i> besides. Others again
have their intellects fly-blown by love, by the same token that most of
the poor wretches<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span> that are in this doleful predicament come out of
<i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and such hot climates. Now and then, indeed,
we have a silly apprentice or so, takes a leap from <i>London-Bridge</i> into
the <i>Thames</i>, or decently hangs himself in a garret, in his mistressâ€™s
garters, but these accidents happen but seldom; and besides, since
fornication has made so great a progress among us, love is observed not
to operate so powerfully in <i>England</i> as it formerly did, when there was
no relief against him but matrimony. Some again have their <i>pia mater</i>
addled by their religion, but neither are the sots of this species so
numerous in <i>Britain</i>, or elsewhere, as they were in the days of yore;
for the priests of most religions have playâ€™d their game so aukwardly,
that not one man in a thousand will trust them with shuffling of the
cards.</p>

<p>But of all the various sorts of mad-men that come hither, the rhimers or
versifyers far exceed the rest in number: most of these fellows in the
other world were mayors, or aldermen, or deputies of wards, that knew
nothing but the rising and falling of stocks, squeezing young heirs, and
cheating their customers: but now the tables are turnâ€™d, for they eat
and drink, nay, sleep and dream in rhime, and have a distich to
discharge at you upon every occasion. With that he openâ€™d the wicket of
the uppermost door, and bid me peep in. â€™Tis impossible to describe to
you the surprize I was in, to see so many of my city acquaintance there,
whom I should sooner have suspected of burglary or sacrilege, than of
tacking a pair of rhimes together: but it seems this is a judgment upon
these wretches, for the aversion they have to the muses when they are
living. The walls were lined with verses from top to bottom, and happy
was the wretch that could get a bit of charcoal to express the happiness
of his fancy upon the poor plaister. The first man I saw was Sir <i>John
Peak</i>, formerly lord-mayor of <i>London</i>, who bluntly came up to the door,
and asked me what was rhime to <i>Crambo</i>? Immediately Sir <i>Thomas
Pilkington</i> poppâ€™d over his shoulder, and pray friend, says he, for I
perceive you are newly come from the other world, how go the affairs of
<i>Parnassus</i>? What new madrigals, epithilamiums, sonnets, epigrams, and
satires, have you brought with you? What pretty conceits had Mr.
<i>Settle</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> in his last <i>London</i> triumphs? What plays have taken of late?
Mrs. <i>Bracegirdle</i>, doth she live still unmarried? And pray, Sir, how
doth Mr. <i>Betterton</i>â€™s lungs hold out? But now I think onâ€™t, I have a
delicious copy of verses to shew you, upon the divine <i>Melesinda</i>â€™s
frying of pancakes, only stay a minute, while I step yonder to fetch
â€™em: he had no sooner turnâ€™d his back, but I pluckâ€™d too the wicket, and
gave him the slip; for certainly of all the plagues in hell, or tâ€™other
side of it, nothing comes up to that of a confounded repeater. Leaving
these versifying insects to themselves, we walked up a pair of stairs
into the upper room, one end of which was the quarter for distracted
lovers, as the other was for the lunatick republicans. I just cast my
eyes into <i>Cupid</i>â€™s <i>Bear-Garden</i>, and observed that the walls were all
adorned with mysterious hieroglyphicks of love, as hearts transfixed,
and abundance of odd-fashionâ€™d battering rams, such as young lovers use
to trace upon the cieling of a coffee-house with the smoke of a candle.
Some half a score of â€™em were making to the door, but having seen enough
of these impertinents in the other world, I had no great inclination to
suffer a new persecution from â€™em in this. So my friend and I turnâ€™d up
to the apartment where the republicans were lockâ€™d up, who made such a
hurricane and noise, as if a legion of devils had been broke loose among
them. <i>Harrington</i>, I remember, was the most unruly of the whole pack.
Thanks to my friends in <i>London</i>, says he, I hear my <i>Oceana</i> is lately
reprinted, and furbishâ€™d with a new dedication to those judicious and
worthy gentlemen, my lord-mayor and court of aldermen, by Mr. <i>Toland</i>.
You need not value yourself so much upon that, says <i>Algernoon Sidney</i>,
for my works were published there long before yours. And so were mine,
cries <i>Milton</i>, at the expence of some worthy patriots, that were not
afraid to publish them under a monarchical government. But what think
you of my memoirs, cries <i>Ludlow</i>, for if you talk of histories, thereâ€™s
a history for you, which, for sincerity and truth, never saw its fellow
since the creation. Upon this the uproar began afresh, so thinking it
high time to withdraw, I joggâ€™d my friend <i>Nokes</i> by the elbow, and as
we went down stairs told him, that <i>Pluto</i> was certainly in the right
onâ€™t, to lock<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span> up these hot-headed mutineers by themselves, allow them
neither pen, ink, fire, nor candle; for should he give them leave to
propagate their seditious doctrines, he would only find himself king of
<i>Erebus</i>, at the courtesy of his loving subjects.</p>

<p>Just as we were going out of this famous edifice; I have an odd piece of
news to tell you, says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, which is, that althoâ€™ we have men of
all countries, more or less here, yet there never was one <i>Irishman</i> in
it. How comes that about, I beseech you? said I to him. Why, replies he,
madness always supposes a loss of reason; but the duce is inâ€™t if a man
can lose that which he never possessâ€™d in his life. Oh your humble
servant, answerâ€™d I, â€™tis well none of our swaggering Dear Joys in
<i>Covent-Garden</i> hear you talk so, for if they did, ten to one but they
would cut your throat for this reflection upon the intellects of their
country, and send you to the Devil for the honour of St. <i>Patrick</i>.</p>

<p>When we came out into the open air again, and had taken half a dozen
turns in the neighbouring fields, Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, says I, â€™tis my
misfortune to come in this place without a farthing of money in my
pocket, and <i>Alecto</i> confound me, if I know what course to take for my
maintenance, therefore I would desire you to put me in a way. Have no
care for that, says Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, his infernal majesty is very kind and
obliging to us players, and because we act so many different parts in
the other world, as kings, princes, bishops, privy-counsellors, beaux,
cits, sailors, and the like, gives us leave to fellow what profession we
have most a fancy to. For my part, I keep a nicknackatory, or toy-shop,
as I formerly did over against the <i>Exchange</i>, and turn a sweet penny by
it, for our gallants here throw away their money after a furious rate.
Now <i>Jo.</i> I think thou canâ€™st not do better than to set up for a
<i>High-German</i> fortune-teller; thou knowest all the cant and roguery of
that practice to perfection, and besides, has the best phiz in the world
to carry on such an affair. As for money to furnish thee an house, and
set up a convenient equipage, to buy thee a pair of globes, a magick
looking-glass, and all other accoutrements of that nature, thou shalt
command as much as thou hast occasion for. I was going to thank my
friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> for so courteous an offer, when who should pop upon us on the
sudden, but his <i>Polish</i> majestyâ€™s physician in ordinary, the late
famous Dr. <i>Conner</i> of <i>Bowstreet</i>, but in so wretched a pickle, so
tatterâ€™d a condition, that I could hardly know him. How comes this
about, noble doctor, said I to him, what is fortune unkind, and do the
planets frown upon merit? I remember you were going to set up your
coach, and marry the widow <i>Bently</i> in <i>Russel-street</i>, just before your
last distemper hurryâ€™d you out of the world. Is it possible the learned
author of <i>Evangelium Medici</i> should want bread? or, doctor, did you
leave all your <i>Hibernian</i> confidence behind you! I thought a true
<i>Irishman</i> could have made his fortune in any part of the universe.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Haines</i>, says he, <i>Pluto</i>, to say no worse of him, is very
ungrateful to the gentlemen of our faculty; and were he not a crownâ€™d
head, I would not stick to call him a <i>Poltroon</i>. I am sure no body of
men cultivate his interest with more industry and success, than we
physicians. What would his dominions be but a bare wilderness and
solitude, if we did not daily take care to stock them with fresh
colonies? This I can say for myself, that I did not let him lose one
patient that fell into my hands; nay, rather than he should want
customers, I practised upon myself. But after the received maxim of most
princes, I find he loves the treason, and hates the traytor; so that no
people are put to harder shifts in hell, than the sons of <i>Galen</i>. Would
you believe it, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, the immortal Dr. <i>Willis</i> is content to be
a flayer of dead horses; the famous <i>Harvey</i> is turnâ€™d higgler, and you
may see him ride every morning to market upon a pannier of eggs;
<i>Mayern</i> is glad to be pimp to noblemenâ€™s <i>valets de chambre</i>; old
<i>Glisson</i> sells vinegar upon a lean scraggy tit; <i>Moreton</i> is returnâ€™d
to his occupation, and preaches in a little conventicle you can hardly
swing a cat round in; <i>Lower</i> sells penny prayer-books all the week, and
curls an <i>Amen</i> in a meeting-house on sundays; <i>Needham</i>, in conjunction
with Capt. <i>Dawson</i>, is bully to a <i>Bordello</i>; and the celebrated
<i>Sydenham</i> empties close-stools. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span> for myself, I am sometimes a small
retainer to a billiard-table; and sometimes, when the matter onâ€™t is
sick, earn a penny by a whimsy-board. I lie with a link-man upon a
flock-bed in a garret, and have not seen a clean shirt upon my back
since I came into this cursed country. By my troth, said I, I am sorry
to hear matters go so scurvily with you; but pluck up a good heart, for
when the times are at worst they must certainly mend. But, pray doctor,
before you go any farther, satisfy me what church you dyâ€™d a member of,
for we had the devil and all to do about you when you were gone. The
parson of St. <i>Giles</i>â€™s stood out stifly that you dyâ€™d a sound
Protestant, but all your countrymen swore thou didst troop off like a
good Catholick. Why really <i>Jo.</i> cryâ€™d the doctor, to deal plainly with
you, I donâ€™t know well what religion I dyâ€™d in; but if I dyâ€™d in any, as
physicians you know seldom do, it was, as I take it, that of the Church
of <i>England</i>. I remember, indeed, when I grew light-headed, and the bed,
room, and every thing began to turn round with me, that a
forster-brother of mine, an <i>Irish</i> Priest, offerâ€™d me the civility of
<i>Extreme Unction</i>, and I that knew I had a long journey to go, thought
it would not be amiss to have my boots well liquorâ€™d before-hand, thoâ€™
ofter all, for any good it did me, he might as well have rubbâ€™d my
posteriors with a brick-bat. This is all I remember of the matter; but
what signifies it to the business we are talking of? In short, <i>Jo.</i> if
thou couldâ€™st put me in a way to live, I should be exceedingly beholden
to thee. Doctor, cryâ€™d I, if you will come to me a week hence, something
may be done; for I intend to build me a stage in one of the largest
<i>Piazzas</i> of this city, take me a fine house, and set up my old trade of
fortune-telling; and as I shall have occasion now and then for some
understrapper to draw teeth for me, or to be my toad-eater upon the
stage, if you will accept of so mean an employment, besides my old
cloaths, which will be something, Iâ€™ll give you meat, drink, washing,
and lodging, and four marks <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>I am sensible, gentlemen, that I have tried your patience with a long
tedious letter, but not knowing when I should find so convenient an
opportunity to send another, I resolved to give you a full account in
this, of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">{18}</a></span> the memorable things that fell within the compass of my
observation, during my short residence in this country. At present,
thanks to my kind stars, I live very comfortably; I keep my brace of
geldings, and half a dozen servants; my house is as well furnishâ€™d as
most in this populous city; and to tell you what prodigious number of
persons of all ages, sexes and conditions flock daily to me, to have
their fortunes told, â€™twould hardly find belief with you. If the
celestial phenomenaâ€™s deceive me not, and there is any truth in the
conjunction of <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Luna</i>, I shall in a short time rout all
the pretenders to <i>Astrology</i>, who combine to ruin my reputation and
practice, but without effect; for this opposition has rather increased
my friends at court than lessenâ€™d them. I am promised to be <i>maÃ®tre des
langues</i>, to the young prince of Acheron, (so we call the heir apparent
to these subterranean dominions) and <i>Proserpineâ€™s camariera major</i>
assured me tâ€™other morning, I should have the honour of teaching the
beautiful princess <i>Fuscamarilla</i>, his sister, to dance. Once more,
gentlemen, I beg your excuse for this prolix epistle, and hoping you
will order one of your fraternity to send me the news of your upper
world, I remain,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><i>An Answer to Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Joseph Haines</span>, High-German <i>Astrologer, at the

<p>
<i>Worthy Sir</i>,<br />
</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E received your letter, dated <i>Dec. 21. 1701.</i> and read it yesterday in
a full assembly at <i>Will</i>â€™s. The whole company likâ€™d it exceedingly, and
return you their thanks for the ample and satisfactory account you have
given them of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s dominions, from which we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_19">{19}</a></span> had little or no
news, however it has happened, since the famous <i>Don Quevedo</i> had the
curiosity to travel thither.</p>

<p>Whereas you desire us, by way of exchange, to furnish you with some of
the most memorable transactions that have lately fallen out in this part
of the globe; we willingly comply with your proposal, and are proud of
any opportunity to shew Mr. <i>Haines</i> how much we respect and value him.</p>

<p><i>Imprimis</i>, <i>Will</i>â€™s coffee-house, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, is much in the same
condition, as when you left it; and as a worthy gentleman has lately
distributed them into their proper classes, we have four sorts of
persons that resort hither; first, Such as are beaux and no wits, and
these are easy to be known by their full periwigs and empty sculls;
secondly, Such as are wits and no beaux, and these, not to talk of their
out-sides, are distinguishâ€™d by censuring the ill taste of the age, and
railing at one another; thirdly, Such as are neither wits nor beaux, I
mean your grave plodding politicians that come to us every night piping
hot from the parliament-house, and finish treaties that were never
thought of, and end wars before they are begun; and fourthly, Such as
are both wits and beaux, to whose persons, as well as merits, you can be
no stranger.</p>

<p>In the next place, the Playhouse stands exactly where it did. Mr. <i>Rich</i>
finds some trouble in managing his mutinous subjects, but â€™tis no more
than what princes must expect to find in a mixt monarchy, as we take the
Playhouse to be. The actors jog on after the old merry rate, and the
women drink and intrigue. Mr. <i>Clinch</i> of <i>Barnet</i>, with his pack of
dogs and organ, comes now and then to their relief; and your friend Mr.
<i>Jevon</i> would hang himself, to see how much the famous Mr. <i>Harvey</i>
exceeds him in the ladder-dance.</p>

<p>We have had an inundation of plays lately, and one of them, by a great
miracle, made shift to hold out a full fortnight. The generality are
either troubled with convulsion-fits, and die the first day of the
representation, or by meer dint of acting, hold out to the third; which
is like a consumptive manâ€™s living by cordials, or else die a violent
death, and are interrâ€™d with the solemnity of catcalls. A merry
virtuoso, who makes one of the congregation <i>de propagando ingenio</i>,
designs to publish a weekly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_20">{20}</a></span> bill for the use of the two theatres, in
imitation of that published by the parish clerks, and faithfully to set
down what distemper every new play dies of.</p>

<p>If the author of a play strains hard for wit, and it drivels drop by
drop from him, he says it is troubled with a strangury. If it is vicious
in the design and performance, and dull throughout, he intends to give
it out in his bill, that it died by a knock in the cradle; if it
miscarries for want of fine scenes, and due acting, why then he says,
â€™tis starvâ€™d at nurse; if it expires the first or second day he reckons
it among the abortive; and lastly, if it is damnâ€™d for the feebleness of
its satire, he says it dies in breeding of teeth.</p>

<p>As our <i>wit</i>, generally speaking is debauchâ€™d, so our wine, the parent
of it, is sophisticated all over the <i>town</i>; and as we never had more
<i>plays</i> in the <i>two houses</i>, and more wine in city than at present, so
we were never encumberâ€™d with worse of the two sorts than now. As for
the latter, we sell that for claret which has not a drop of the juice of
the grape in it, but is downright cyder. The corporation does not stop
short here, but our cyder, instead of apples, is made of turnips. Who
knows where the cheat will conclude? perhaps the next generation will
debauch our very turnips.</p>

<p>â€™Tis well, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, you dyâ€™d when you did, for that unhappy place,
where you have so often exerted your talent, I mean <i>Smithfield</i>, has
fallen under the city magistrateâ€™s displeasure; so that now St. <i>George</i>
and the <i>Dragon</i>, the <i>Trojan</i> horse, and <i>Bateman</i>â€™s ghost, the
<i>Prodigal Son</i>, and <i>Jeptha</i>â€™s <i>Daughter</i>: In short, all the drolls of
glorious memory, are routed, defeated, and sent to grass, without any
hopes of a reprieve.</p>

<p>Next to <i>plays</i>, we have been over-run, in these times of publick
ferment and distraction, with certain wicked things, called <i>pamphlets</i>;
and some scriblers that shall be nameless, have writ <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>
upon the same subject, at least six times since last spring.</p>

<p>Both nations are at <i>bay</i>, and like two <i>bull-dogs</i> snarl at one
another, yet have not thought fit, as yet, to come to actual blows. What
the event will be, we cannot prophesy at this distance, but every little
corporation in the kingdom has laid <i>Lewis le Grand</i> upon his back, and
as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_21">{21}</a></span> good as callâ€™d him perjurâ€™d knave and villain. However, â€™tis the
hardest case in the world if we miscarry; our <i>Grub-street</i> pamphleteers
advise the shires and boroughs what sort of members to chuse; the shires
and boroughs advise their representatives what course to steer in
parliament; and the senators, no doubt onâ€™t, will advise his majesty
what ministers to rely on, and how to behave himself in this present
conjuncture. Thus, advice, you see, like malt-tickets, circulates
plentifully about the kingdom; so that if we fail in our designs, after
all, the wicked can never say, â€™twas for want of advice. We forgot to
tell you, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, that since you left this upper world, your life
has been written by a brother-player, who pretends he received all his
<i>memoirs</i> from your own mouth, a little before you made a leap into the
dark; and really you are beholden to the fellow, for he makes you a
master of arts at the university, thoâ€™ you never took a degree there.
That, and a thousand stories of other people he has fatherâ€™d upon you,
and the truth onâ€™t is, the adventures of thy life, if truly set down,
are so romantick, that few besides thy acquaintance would be able to
distinguish between the history and the fable. But let not this disturb
the serenity of your soul, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, for after this rate the lives
of all illustrious persons, whether ancient or modern, have been
written. This, Mr. <i>Haines</i>, is all we have to communicate to you at
present, so we conclude, with subscribing ourselves,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>LL the conversation of this lower world, at present, runs upon you; and
the devil a word we can hear in any of our coffee-houses, but what his
<i>Gallic</i> Majesty is more or less concernâ€™d in. â€™Tis agreed on by all
our<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_22">{22}</a></span> <i>Virtuosos</i>, that since the days of <i>Dioclesian</i>, no prince has
been so great a benefactor to hell as your self; and as much a matter of
eloquence as I was once thought to be at <i>Paris</i>, I want words to tell
you, how much you are commended here for so heroically trampling under
foot the treaty of <i>Reswick</i>, and opening a new scene of war in your
great <i>climateric</i>, at which age most of the princes before you were
such recreants, as to think of making up their scores with heaven, and
leaving their neighbours in peace. But you, they say, are above such
sordid precedents, and rather than <i>Pluto</i> should want men to people his
dominions, are willing to spare him half a million of your own subjects,
and that at a juncture too, when you are not overstockâ€™d with them.</p>

<p>This has gainâ€™d you an universal applause in these regions; the three
<i>Furies</i> sing your praises in every street; <i>Bellona</i> swears thereâ€™s
never a prince in <i>Christendom</i> worth hanging besides your self; and
<i>Charon</i> bustles for you in all companies: he desirâ€™d me, about a week
ago, to present his most humble respects to you; adding, that if it had
not been for your majesty, he, with his wife and children, must long ago
been quarterâ€™d upon the parish; for which reason he duly drinks your
health every morning in a cup of cold <i>Styx</i> next his conscience.</p>

<p>Indeed I have a double title to write to you, in the first place, as one
of your dutiful, thoâ€™ unworthy, subjects, who formerly tasted of your
liberality; and secondly, as you have done me the honour to take away my
late wife, not only into your private embraces, but private councils.
Poor soul! I little thought she would fall to your majestyâ€™s share when
I took my last farwel of her, or that a prince that had his choice of so
many thousands, would accept of my sorry leavings. And therefore, I must
confess, I am apt to be a little vain, as often as I reflect, that the
greatest monarch in the universe and I are brother-stallions, and that
the eldest son of the church, and the little <i>Scarron</i> have fishâ€™d in
the same hole. Some sawcy fellows have had the impudence to tell me to
my face, that Madam <i>Maintenon</i> (for so, out of respect to your majesty,
I must call her) is your lawful wife, and that you were clandestinely
marryâ€™d to her. I took them up roundly, as they deservâ€™d, and told them,
I was sure it was a dam<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_23">{23}</a></span>nâ€™d lie; for, said I to them, if my master was
marryâ€™d to her, as you pretend, she had broke his heart long ago, as
well as she did mine; from whence I positively concluded, that she might
be your mistress, but was none of your wife.</p>

<p>Last week, as I was sitting with some of my acquaintance in a
publick-house, after a great deal of impertinent chat about the affairs
of the <i>Milanese</i>, and the intended siege of <i>Mantua</i>, the whole company
fell a talking of your majesty, and what glorious exploits you had
performâ€™d in your time. Why, gentlemen, says an ill-lookâ€™d rascal, who
provâ€™d to be <i>Herostratus</i>, for <i>Pluto</i>â€™s sake let not the grand monarch
run away with all your praises. I have done something memorable in my
time too; â€™twas I, who out of the <i>Gaiete de CÅ“ur</i>, and to perpetuate my
name, firâ€™d the famous temple of the <i>Ephesian Diana</i>, and in two hours
consumed that magnificent structure which was two hundred years a
building: therefore, gentlemen, lavish not away all your praises, I
beseech you, upon one man, but allow others their share. Why, thou
diminutive inconsiderable wretch said I, in a great passion to him, thou
worthless idle <i>logger head</i>, thou <i>pigmy</i> in sin, thou <i>Tom Thumb</i> in
iniquity, how dares such a puny insect as thou art, have the impudence
to enter the lists with <i>Lewis le Grand</i>? thou valuest thy self upon
firing a church, but how? when the mistress of the house, who was a
midwife by profession, was gone out to assist <i>Olympias</i>, and deliverâ€™d
her of <i>Alexander</i> the Great. â€™Tis plain, thou hadst not the courage to
do it when the goddess was present, and upon the spot; but what is this
to what my royal master can boast of, that had destroyed a hundred and a
hundred such foolish fabricks in his time, and bravely ordered them to
be bombarded, when he knew the very God that made and redeemed him had
taken up his <i>Quarters</i> in â€™em. Therefore turn out of the room, like a
paltry insignificant villain as thou art, or Iâ€™ll pick thy carcass for
thee.</p>

<p>He had no sooner made his <i>exit</i>, but cries an odd sort of a spark, with
his hat buttonâ€™d up before, like a country scraper, under favour, Sir,
what do you think of me? Why, who are you? replyâ€™d I to him, Who am I,
answerâ€™d he, Why <i>Nero</i>, the sixth emperor of <i>Rome</i>, that murderâ€™d
my&#8212;&#8212; Come, said I to him, to stop your prating, I know your history as
well as yourself, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_24">{24}</a></span> murderâ€™d your mother, kickâ€™d your wife down
stairs, dispatchâ€™d two Apostles out of the world, begun the first
persecution against the christians, and, lastly, put your master
<i>Seneca</i> to death. As for the murder of your mother, I confess it shewâ€™d
you had some taste of wickedness, and may pass for a tolerable piece of
gallantry; but prithee, what a mighty matter was it to send your wife
packing with a good kick in the guts, when once she grew nauseous and
sawcy; â€™tis no more than what a thousand tinkers and foot-soldiers have
done before you: or to put the penal laws in execution against a brace
of hot-headed bigots, and their besotted followers, that must needs come
and preach up a new religion at <i>Rome</i>: or, in fine, to take away a
haughty, ungrateful pedantâ€™s life, who conspirâ€™d to take away yourâ€™s;
althoâ€™ I know those worthy gentlemen, the school-masters, make a horrid
rout about it in their nonsensical declamations? Whereas his most
<i>Christian Majesty</i>, whose advocate I am resolved to be against all
opposers whatever, has bravely and generously starvâ€™d a million of poor
<i>Hugonots</i> at home, and sent tâ€™other million of them a grasing into
foreign countries, contrary to solemn edicts, and repeated promises, for
no other provocation, that I know of, but because they were such
coxcombs, as to place him upon the throne. In short, friend <i>Nero</i>, thou
mayâ€™st pass for a rogue of the third or fourth class; but be advised by
a stranger, and never shew thyself such a fool as to dispute the
pre-eminence with <i>Lewis le Grand</i>, who has murderâ€™d more men in his
reign, let me tell thee, than thou hast murderâ€™d tunes, for all thou art
the vilest thrummer upon cat-gut the sun ever beheld. However, to give
the Devil his due, I will say it before thy face, and behind thy back,
that if thou hadâ€™st reignâ€™d as many years as my gracious master has
done, and hadâ€™st had, instead of <i>Tigellinus</i>, a <i>Jesuit</i> or two to have
governâ€™d thy conscience, thou mightest, in all probability, have made a
much more magnificent figure, and been inferior to none but the mighty
monarch I have been talking of.</p>

<p>Having put my <i>Roman</i> emperor to silence, I lookâ€™d about me, and saw a
pack of grammarians (for so I guessed them to be by their impertinence
and noise) disputing it very fiercely at the next table; the matter in
de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_25">{25}</a></span>bate was, which was the most heroical age; and one of them, who
valuâ€™d himself very much upon his reading, maintainâ€™d, that the heroical
age, properly so callâ€™d, began with the <i>Theban</i>, and ended with the
<i>Trojan</i> war, in which compass of time, that glorious constellation of
heroes, <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Jason</i>, <i>Theseus</i>, <i>TidÃ¦us</i>, with <i>Agamemnon</i>,
<i>Ajax</i>, <i>Achilles</i>, <i>Hector</i>, <i>Troilus</i>, and <i>Diomedes</i> flourished: men
that had all signalizâ€™d themselves by their personal gallantry, and
valour. His next neighbour argued very fiercely for the age wherein
<i>Alexander</i> founded the <i>Grecian</i> monarchy, and saw so many noble
generals and commanders about him. The third was as obstreperous for
that of <i>Julius CÃ¦sar</i>, and managâ€™d his argument with so much heat, that
I expected every minute when these puppies wouâ€™d have gone to
loggerheads in good earnest. To put an end to your controversy,
gentlemen, says I to them, you may talk till your lungs are founderâ€™d,
but this I positively assert, that the present age we live in is the
most heroical age, and that my master, <i>Lewis le Grand</i> is the greatest
hero of it. Hark you me, Sir, how do you make that appear, cryâ€™d the
whole pack of them, opening upon me all at once: by your leave,
gentlemen, answerâ€™d I, two to one is odds at foot-ball; but having a
heroâ€™s cause to defend, I find myself possessâ€™d with a heroâ€™s vigour and
resolution, and donâ€™t doubt but I shall bring you over to my party. That
age therefore is the most heroical which is the boldest and bravest; the
antients, I grant you, whorâ€™d and got drunk, and cut throats as well as
we do; but, gentlemen, they did not sin upon the same foot as we, nor
had so many wicked discouragements to deter them; we whore when we know
â€™tis ten to one but we get a clap for our pains; whereas our
fore-fathers, before the siege of <i>Naples</i>, had no such blessing to
apprehend; we drink and murther one another in cold blood, at the same
time we believe that we must be rewarded with damnation; but your old
heroâ€™s had no notion at all, or at least an imperfect one of a future
state: so â€™tis a plain case, you see, that the heroism lies on our side.
To apply this then to my royal master; he has fillâ€™d all Christendom
with blood and confusion; he has broke throâ€™ the most solemn treaties
sworn at the altar; he has strayâ€™d and undone infinite<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">{26}</a></span> numbers of poor
wretches; and all this for his own glory and ambition, when heâ€™s assured
that hell gapes every moment for him: now tell me, whether your
<i>Jasons</i>, your <i>Agamemnons</i>, or <i>Alexanders</i>, durst have venturâ€™d so
heroically; or whether your pitiful emperors of <i>Germany</i>, your
mechanick kings of <i>England</i> and <i>Sweden</i>, or your lousy States of
<i>Holland</i>, have courage enough to write after so illustrous a copy.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, you may see with what zeal I appear in your majestyâ€™s behalf,
and that I omit no opportunity of magnifying your great exploits to the
utmost of my poor abilities. At the same time I must freely own to you,
that I have met with some rough-hewn sawcy rascals, that have stoppâ€™d me
in my full career, when I have been expatiating upon your praises, and
have so dumbfounded me with their villainous objections, that I could
not tell how to reply to them.</p>

<p>Some few days ago it was my fortune to affirm, in a full assembly, that
since the days of <i>Charlemagne</i>, <i>France</i> was never blessâ€™d with so
renownâ€™d, so victorious, and so puissant a prince as your majesty. You
lame, gouty coxcomb, says a sawcy butter-box of a <i>Dutchman</i> to me,
donâ€™t give yourself these airs in our company; <i>Lewis</i>, the greatest
prince that <i>France</i> ever had! Why, I tell thee, he has no more title to
that crown, than I have to the <i>Great Mogul</i>â€™s; and <i>Lewis</i> the
thirteenth was no more his father than the Pope of <i>Rome</i> is thine. I
blessâ€™d myself to hear the fellow deliver this with so serious a mien,
when a countryman of his taking up the cudgels; â€™Tis true, says he, your
mighty monarch has no right to the throne he possesses; the late king
had no hand in the begetting of him, but a lusty proper young fellow,
one <i>le Grand</i> by name, and an Apothecary by profession, was employâ€™d by
cardinal <i>Mazarine</i>, who had preparâ€™d the queenâ€™s conscience for the
taking of such a dose, to strike an heir for <i>France</i> out of her
majestyâ€™s body; by the same token that this scarlet agent of hell, got
him fairly poisonâ€™d as soon as he had done the work, for fear of telling
tales. If you ever read <i>Virgil</i>â€™s life written by <i>Donatus</i>, cries a
third to me, youâ€™ll find that <i>Augustus</i> having rewarded that famous
poet for some little services done him, with a parcel of loaves, had the
curiosity once to en<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_27">{27}</a></span>quire of him who he thought was his father? to
which question of the emperor, <i>Virgil</i> fairly answerâ€™d, that he
believâ€™d him to be a Bakerâ€™s son, because he still paid him in a Bakerâ€™s
manufacture, <i>viz.</i> bread. And thus, were there no other proofs to
confirm it, yet any one would swear that <i>Lewis le Grand</i> is an
Apothecaryâ€™s son, because he has acted all his life-time the part of an
Apothecary.</p>

<p><i>Imprimis</i>, He has given so many strong purges to his own kingdom, that
he has emptyâ€™d it of half its people and money. <i>Item</i>, He applyâ€™d
costives to <i>Genoa</i> and <i>Brussels</i>, when he bombarded both those cities.
<i>Item</i>, He gave a damnâ€™d clyster to the <i>Hollanders</i> with a witness,
when he fell upon the rear of their provinces, in the year 72. <i>Item</i>,
He lullâ€™d king <i>Charles</i> the second asleep with female opiates. <i>Item</i>,
He forced Pope <i>Innocent</i> the eleventh, to swallow the unpalatable
draught of the <i>Franchises</i>. <i>Item</i>, He administrated a restorative
cordial to <i>Mahumetanisme</i>, when he enterâ€™d into an alliance with the
<i>Grand Turk</i> against the emperor. <i>Item</i>, He would have bubbled the
prince of <i>Orange</i> with the gilded pill of sovereignty, but his little
cousin was wiser than to take it. And lastly, If he had restorâ€™d king
<i>James</i> to his crown again, he would have brought the people of
<i>England</i> a most conscientious Apothecaryâ€™s bill for his waiting and
attending. In short, shake this mighty monarch in a bag, turn him this
way, and that way, and tâ€™other way, <i>sursum, deorsum, quaquaversum</i>,
Iâ€™ll engage youâ€™ll find him nothing but a meer Apothecary; and I hope
the emperor and king of <i>England</i> will play the Apothecary too in their
turn, and make him vomit up all those provinces and kingdoms he has so
unrighteously usurpâ€™d. Prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i> has workâ€™d him pretty
well this last summer, and â€™tis an infallible prognostic, that heâ€™s
reduced to the last extremities, when his spiritual physicians apply
pigeons to the soles of his feet; I mean prayers and masses, and advise
him to reconcile himself to that Heaven he has so often affronted with
his most execrable perjuries.</p>

<p>â€™Tis impossible for me to tell your majesty, what a surprize I was in to
hear this graceless <i>Netherlander</i> blaspheme your glorious name after
this insufferable rate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span> But to see how one persecution treads upon the
heels of another! I was hardly recoverâ€™d out of my astonishment, when a
son of a whore of a <i>German</i>, advancing towards me, was pleasâ€™d to
explain himself as follows:</p>

<p>You keep a pother and noise here about your mighty monarch, says he to
me, but what has this mighty monarch, and be damnâ€™d to you, done to
merit any bodyâ€™s good word? I say, what one generous noble exploit has
he been guilty of in his whole reign, as long as it is, to deserve so
much incense and flattery, so many statues and triumphal arches, which a
pack of mercenary, nauseous, fulsome slaves have bestowâ€™d upon him? For
my part, continues he, when I first heard his historians and poets, his
priests and courtiers, talk such wonderful things of him, I fancyâ€™d that
another <i>Cyrus</i> or <i>Alexander</i> had appeared upon the stage; but when I
observed him more narrowly, and by a truer light, I found this immortal
man, as his inscriptions vainly stile him, to be a little, tricking,
pilfering <i>Fripon</i>, that watchâ€™d the critical minute of stealing towns,
as nicely as your rogues of an inferior sphere do that of nimming
cloaks; and thoâ€™ he had the fairest opportunity of erecting a new
western monarchy that ever any prince couâ€™d boast of, since the
declension of the <i>Roman</i> empire; yet to his eternal disgrace be it
said, no man could have made a worse use of all those wonderful
advantages, that fortune, and the stupid security of his neighbours
conspirâ€™d to put into his hands. To convince you of the truth of this,
let us only consider what posture the affairs of <i>France</i> were in at his
accession to that crown, and several years after, as likewise how all
the neighbouring princes and states about him stood affected: to begin
then with the former, he found himself master of the best disciplinâ€™d
troops in the universe, commanded by the most experienced generals that
any one age had producâ€™d, and spirited by a long train of victories,
over a careless, desponding, lazy enemy. All the great men of his
kingdom so depressed and humbled by the fortunate artifices of
<i>Richlieu</i> and <i>Mazarine</i>, that they were not capable of giving him any
uneasiness at home, the sole power of raising money entirely in his own
hands, and his parliaments so far from giving a check to his daily
encroachments upon their li<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span>berties, that they were made the most
effectual instruments of his tyranny: In short, his clergy as much
devoted, and the whole body of his people as subservient to him as a
prince couâ€™d wish. As far his neighbours, he who was best able of any to
put a stop to his growing greatness, I mean the king of <i>England</i>,
either favourâ€™d his designs clandestinely, or was so enervated by his
pleasure, that provided he couâ€™d enjoy an inglorious effeminacy at home,
he seemâ€™d not to lay much to heart what became of the rest of
Christendom.</p>

<p>The emperor was composing anthems for his chapel at <i>Vienna</i>, when he
shouâ€™d have appeared at the head of his troops on the <i>Rhine</i>. The
princes of <i>Germany</i> were either divided from the common interest by the
underhand management of <i>France</i>, or not at all concerned at the
impending storm that threatned them. The <i>Hollanders</i> within an ace of
losing their liberty by the preposterous care they took to secure it; I
mean, by diverting that family of all power in their government, which,
as it had formerly erected their republick, so now was the only one that
couâ€™d help to protect it.</p>

<p>The little states and principalities of <i>Italy</i>, looking on at a
distance, and not daring to declare themselves in so critical a
conjuncture, when the two keys of their country, <i>Pignerol</i> and <i>Casal</i>
hung at the girdle of <i>France</i>. In short, the dispeoplâ€™d monarchy of
<i>Spain</i>, governed by a soft unactive prince, equally unfit for the
cabinet and the field; his counsellors, who managâ€™d all under him,
taking no care to lay up magazines, and put their towns in a posture of
defence, but wholly relying as for that, upon their neighbours; like
some inconsiderate spend-thrift thrown into a jail by his creditors,
that smoakes and drinks, and talks merrily all the while, but never
advances one step to make his circumstances easy to him, leaving the
burthen of that affair to his friends and relations, whom perhaps he
never obliged so far in his prosperity, as to deserve it from their
hands.</p>

<p>Here now, says he, was the fairest opportunity that ever presented
itself for a prince of gallantry and resolution, for a <i>Tamerlane</i> and a
<i>Scanderbeg</i>, to have done something eminently signal in his generation;
and if in the last century, a little king of <i>Sweden</i>, with a handful<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span>
of men, couâ€™d force his way from the <i>Baltick</i> to the <i>Rhine</i>, and fill
all <i>Germany</i> with terror and consternation, what might we not have
expected from a powerful king of <i>France</i>, in the flower of his youth,
and at the head of two hundred thousand effective men, especially when
there was no visible power to oppose him? But this wonderful monarch of
yours, instead of carrying his arms beyond the <i>Danube</i>, and performing
any one action worthy for his historians to record in the annals of his
reign, has humbly contented himself, now and then, in the beginning of
the year, when he knew his neighbours were unprepared for such a visit,
to invest some little market-town in <i>Flanders</i>, with his invincible
troops; and when a parcel of silly implicit fools had done the business
for him; then, forsooth, he must appear at the head of his court harlots
and minstrels, and make a magnificent entry throâ€™ the breach: And after
this ridiculous piece of pageantry is over, return back again to
<i>Versailles</i>, with the fame equipage, orderâ€™d new medals, operas, and
sonnets to be made upon the occasion; and what ought by no means to be
omitted, our most trusty and well-beloved counsellor and cousin, the
archbishop of <i>Paris</i>, must immediately have a letter sent him, to
repair forthwith, at the head of his ecclesiastick myrmidons, to <i>NÃ´tre
Dame</i>, and there to thank God for the success of an infamous robbery,
which an honest moral pagan would have blushâ€™d at. So that when the next
fit of his <i>fistula in ano</i> shall send this immortal town-stealer, this
divine village-lifter, this heroic pilferer of poor hamlets and their
dependancies, down to these subterranean dominions, donâ€™t imagine that
heâ€™ll be allowed to keep company with the <i>Pharamonds</i> and
<i>Charlemagnes</i> of <i>France</i>, the <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Henries</i> of <i>England</i>,
the <i>Williams</i> of the <i>Nassovian</i> family, or the <i>Alexanders</i> and
<i>CÃ¦sars</i> of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>. No, shouâ€™d he have the impudence to
shew his head among that illustrious assembly, they wouâ€™d soon order
their footmen to drub him into better manners: Neither, cries a surly
<i>Englishman</i>, clapping his sides, and interrupting him, must he expect
the favour to appear even among our holyday heroes, and custard stormers
of <i>Cheapside</i>, those merry burlesques of the art military in
<i>Finsbury-fields</i>, who, poor creatures! never meant the destruction of
any mortal thing, but transitory roast-beaf and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span> capon: no, friend, says
he, <i>Lewis le Grand</i> must expect to take up his habitation in the most
infamous quarter of <i>Hell</i>, among a parcel of house-breakers and
shop-lifters, rogues burnt in the cheek for petty-larceny and burglary,
brethren of the moon, gentlemen of the horn-thumb, pillagers of the
hedges and henroosts, conveyers of silver spoons, and camblet cloaks,
and such like enterprising heroes, whose famous actions are faithfully
registerâ€™d in our sessions-papers and dying-speeches, transmitted to
posterity by the Ordinary of <i>Newgate</i>; a much more impartial historian
than your <i>Pelissons</i> and <i>Boileaus</i>. However, as I was informâ€™d last
week by an understrapper at court; <i>Pluto</i>, in consideration of the
singular services your royal master has done him, will allow him a brace
of fiddlers to scrape and sing to him wherever he goes, since he takes
such a delight to hear his own praises.</p>

<p>I must confess, says another leering rogue, a countryman of his, that
since the grand monarch we have been speaking of, who has all along done
more by his bribing and tricking, than by the conduct of his generals,
or the bravery of his troops, who has plaid at fast and loose with his
neighbours ever since he came to the crown, who has surprised abundance
of towns in his time, and at the next treaty been forced to spue up
those very places he ordered <i>Te Deum</i> to be sung for a few months
before. I must confess, says he, that since in conjunction with a damnâ€™d
mercenary priest, he has forgâ€™d a will for his brother-in-law of
<i>Spain</i>, and placâ€™d his grandson upon that throne, I should think the
rest of Christendom in a very bad condition indeed, if he should be
suffered to go on quietly with his show a few years more: Then for all I
know, he might bid fair to set up a new empire in the west, which he has
been aiming at so long: But if the last advice from the other world
donâ€™t deceive us: If the parliament of <i>England</i> goes on as unanimously
as they have begun, to support their prince in so pious and necessary a
war; in short, if the emperor, the <i>Dutch</i>, and the other allies, act
with that vigour and resolution as it becomes them upon this pressing
occasion, I make no question to see this mighty hero plunderâ€™d like the
jay in the fable, of all the fine plumes he has borrowâ€™d, and reducâ€™d to
so low an ebb, that he shall not find it in his power, thoâ€™ he has never
so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_32">{32}</a></span> much in his will, to disturb the peace of the christian world any
more. And this, continues he, is as favourable an opportunity as we
could desire, to strip him of all his usurpations; for heaven be
praised, <i>Spain</i> at present is a burthen to him, and by grasping at too
much, heâ€™s in a fair way to lose every farthing. Besides, this late
forgery of the will has pluckâ€™d off his old mask, and shews that â€™tis an
universal monarchy he intends, and not the repose of <i>Europe</i>, which has
been so fortunate a sham to him in all his other treaties; so that the
devilâ€™s in the allies now, if they donâ€™t see throâ€™ those thin pretences
he so often bubbled them with formerly; or lay down their arms, till
they have made this <i>French</i> bustard, who is all feathers, and no
substance, as bare and naked as a skeleton; and effectually spoil his
new trade of making wills for other people. And this they may easily
bring about, continues he, if they lay hold on the present opportunity,
for as I observed to you before, he has taken more business upon his
hands than heâ€™ll ever be able to manage, and by grasping at too much, is
in the direct road to lose all. For my part, I never think of him, but
he puts me in mind of a silly foolish fellow I knew once in <i>London</i>,
who was a common knife-grinder about the streets, and having in this
humble occupation gathered a few straggling pence, must needs take a
great house in <i>Fleetstreet</i>, and set up for a sword-cutler; but before
quarter-day came, finding the rent too bulky for him, he very fairly
rubbâ€™d off with all his effects, and left his landlord the key under the
door. Without pretending to the spirit of <i>Nostradamus</i>, or <i>Lilly</i>,
this I foresee, will be the fate of <i>Lewis le Grand</i>; therefore when you
write next to your glorious monarch, pray give my respects to him, and
bid him remember the sad destiny of the poor knife-grinder of <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>Thus you see, Sir, how I am daily plaguâ€™d and harrassâ€™d by a parcel of
brawny impudent rascals, and all for espousing your quarrel, and crying
up the justice of your arms. For <i>Pluto</i>â€™s sake let me conjure your
majesty to lay your commands upon <i>Boileau</i>, <i>Racine</i>, or any of your
panegyrists, to instruct me how I may stop the mouths of these
impertinent babblers for the future, who make Hell ten times more
insupportable than otherwise it would be, and threaten to toss me in a
blanket the next time I come<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_33">{33}</a></span> unprovided for your defence into their
company. In the mean time, humbly desiring your majesty to present my
love to the <i>quondam</i> wife of my bosom, I mean the virtuous madam
<i>Maintenon</i>, who, in conjunction with your most christian majesty, now
governs all <i>France</i>; and put her in mind of sending me a dozen of new

may justly call him, since we have droppâ€™d our old animosities, and now
live amicably together) is eternally talking of your conduct and
bravery; nay, <i>Alexander the Great</i>, who can hardly bear any competitor
in the point of glory, has freely confessed, that your gallantry in
passing the <i>Po</i> and <i>Adige</i>, in the face of so powerful an enemy, falls
not short of what he himself formerly shewâ€™d upon the banks of the
<i>Granicus</i>. For my part, I have a thousand obligations to you. My march
over the <i>Alpes</i>, upon which I may deservedly value myself, was lookâ€™d
upon here to be fabulous, till your late expedition over those rugged
mountains confirmâ€™d the belief of it. Thus neither hills nor rivers can
stop the progress of your victories, and â€™tis you who have found out the
lucky secret, how to baffle the circumspect gravity of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
and repress the furious impetuosity of the <i>French</i>. His <i>Gallic</i>

his cost, that all the laurels he has been so long, a plun<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_34">{34}</a></span>dering, will
at last fall to your excellencyâ€™s share; and that he has been labouring
forty years together to no other purpose, than to enrich you with the
spoils of his former triumphs. Go on, therefore, in the glorious track
as you have begun, and be assured, that the good wishes of all the great
and illustrious persons now resident in this lower world attend you in
all your enterprizes. As nothing can be a greater pleasure to virtuous
men, than to see villains rewarded according to their deserts; so true
heroes never rejoice more than when they see a sham-conqueror, and vain
glorious bully, such as <i>Lewis</i> XIV. plunderâ€™d of all his unjust
acquisitions, and reduced to his primitive state of nothing. Were there
a free communication between our territories and yours, <i>Cyrus</i>,
<i>Miltiades</i>, <i>CÃ¦sar</i>, and a thousand other generals, would be proud to
offer you their service the next campaign; but â€™tis your happiness that
you want not their assistance; your own personal bravery, joinâ€™d to that
of your troops, and the justice of your cause, being sufficient to carry
you throâ€™ all your undertakings.</p>

as we had in yourâ€™s) when my landlord persecutes me for rent, my

of <i>Thebes</i>, spared all of my family; nay, the very house I lived in:
but thou, who hast a genius superior to him, hast not spared me, even in
what I value most, my verification and good name, for which <i>Apollo</i> in
due time reward thee.</p>

<p><i>Dear Royal Brother and Cousin</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HOâ€™ I have traversâ€™d the vast abyss that lies betwixt us; and am now at
some hundred millions of leagues distance from you, yet do I still
remember the promise I made you before my departure, to send you an
account of my journey hither. Know then, that all the stories you hear
of the mansions of the dead, are flim-flams, invented by the crafty, to
terrify and manage the weak. Hereâ€™s no such thing as <i>Hell</i> or
<i>Purgatory</i>; no <i>Lake of fire and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span> brimstone</i>; no <i>cleven-footed
devils</i>; no <i>land of darkness</i>. This place is wonderfully well lighted
by a never decaying effulgence, which flows from the Almighty; and the
pleasures we dead enjoy, and the torments we endure, consist in a full
and clear view of our past actions, whether good or bad; and in being in
such or such company as is allotted us. For my part, I am continually
tormented with the thoughts of having lost three goodly kingdoms by my
infatuation and bigotry; and to aggravate my pain, I am quarterâ€™d with
my royal father <i>Charles</i> I. my honest well meaning brother <i>Charles</i>
II. and the subtle <i>Machiavel</i>; the first reproaches me ever and anon,
with my not having made better use of his dreadful examples; the second,
with having despisâ€™d his wholsome advices; and the third, with having
misapplyâ€™d his maxims, throâ€™ the wrong suggestions of my father
confessor. Oh! that I had as little religion as your self, or as
<i>S</i>&#8212;&#8212; <i>M</i>&#8212;&#8212;, <i>R</i>&#8212;&#8212; <i>H</i>&#8212;&#8212;, and some others, of my ministers, and
my predecessors; then might I have reignâ€™d with honour, and in plenty
over a nation, which is ever loyal and faithful to a prince who is
tender of their laws and liberties; and peacefully resignâ€™d my crown my
lawfully begotten son; whereas throâ€™ the delusions of priest-craft, and
the fond insinuations of a bigotted wife, I endeavoured to establish the
superstitions of <i>Popery</i>, and the fatal maxims of a despotick,
dispensing power, upon the ruins of the <i>Protestant Religion</i>, and of
the fundamental laws of a free people, which at last concluded with my
abdication and exile. I am sorry you have deviated from your wonted
custom of breaking your word, and that you have punctually observâ€™d the
promise you made me at my dying bed, of acknowledging my dear son as
king of <i>Great-Britain</i>; for I fear my <i>quondam</i> subjects, who love to
contradict you in every thing, will from thence take occasion to abjure
him for ever; whereas had you disowned him, they would perhaps have
acknowledged him in mere spite. Cardinal <i>Richlieu</i>, who visits me
often, professes still a great deal of zeal and affection for your
government, but is extremely concernâ€™d at the wrong measures you take to
arrive at universal monarchy. He has desirâ€™d me to advise you to keep
the old method he chalkâ€™d out for you, which is, to trust more to your
gold than to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_37">{37}</a></span> your arms. I cannot but think he is in the right onâ€™t,
considering the wonderful success the first has lately had with the
archbishop of <i>Cologn</i>, and some other of the <i>German</i> and <i>Italian</i>
princes, and the small progress your armies have made in the <i>Milanese</i>.
But the wholesomeness of his advice is yet better justifyâ€™d by your
dealings with the <i>English</i>, whom you know, you have always found more
easily bribed than bullied. Therefore, as you tender the grandeur of
your monarchy, and the interest of my dear son, instead of raising new
forces, and fitting out fleets, be sure to send a cart-load of your
new-coinâ€™d <i>Lewis dâ€™ors</i> into <i>England</i>, in order to divide the nation,
and set the <i>Whigs</i> and <i>Tories</i> together by the ears. But take care you
trust your money in the hands of a person that knows how to distribute
it to more advantage than either count <i>T&#8212;&#8212;d</i> or <i>P&#8212;&#8212;n</i>, who, as I
am told, have lavishâ€™d away your favours all at once upon insatiable
cormorants, and extravagant gamesters and spendthrifts. â€™Tis true, by
their assistance, and the unwearied diligence of my loyal <i>Jacobites</i>,
you have made a shift to get the old ministry discarded, and to retard
the grand alliance; but let me tell you, unless you see them afresh,
they will certainly leave you in the lurch at the next sessions; for
ingratitude and corruption do always go together. Therefore to keep
these mercenary rogues to their behaviour, and in perpetual dependance,
you must feed them with small portions, as weekly, or monthly allowance.
Above all, bid your agents take heed how they deal with a certain
indefatigable writer, who, as long as your gold has lasted, has been
very useful to our cause, and boldly defeated the dangerous counsels of
the <i>Whigs</i>, your implacable enemies; but who, upon the first
withdrawing of your bounty, will infallibly turn cat in pan, and write
for the house of <i>Austria</i>.</p>

<p>I could give you more instructions in relation to <i>England</i>, but not
knowing whether they would be taken in good part, I forbear them for the
present. Pray comfort my dear spouse with a royal kiss, and tell her, I
wait her coming with impatience. Bid my beloved son not despair of
ascending my throne, that is, provided he shakes off the fetters of the
<i>Romish</i> superstition; let him not despond upon account of my unfaithful
servant <i>Fuller</i>â€™s evidence against his legitimacy, for the depositions
of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">{38}</a></span> nobility, which are still upon record in the Chancery, will
easily defeat that perjurâ€™d fellowâ€™s pretended proof, with all honest
considering men. And as for the numerous addresses, which I hear, are
daily presented to my successor against him, he may find as many in my
strong box, which were presented to me in his favour, both before and
after his birth. The last courier brought us news of a pretended
miracle, wrought by my body at the <i>Benedictines</i> church; I earnestly
desire you to disabuse the world, and keep the imposture from getting
ground; for how is it possible I should cure eye-fistulas, now I am
dead, that could not ease myself of a troublesome corn in my toe when
living? My service to all our friends and acquaintance; be assurâ€™d that
all the <i>Lethean</i> waters shall never wash away from my memory the great
services I have received at your hands in the other world; nor the
inviolable affection, which makes me subscribe myself,</p>

<p><i>Most beloved Royal Brother and Cousin</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OURâ€™S I received this morning, and no sooner cast my eyes upon the
superscription, but I guessâ€™d it to be written by one of my fellow
kings, by the scrawl and ill spelling. I am glad your account of the
other world agrees so well with the thoughts I always entertained about
it: For, between friends, I never believâ€™d the stories the priests tell
us of hell and purgatory. Ambition has ever been my religion; and my
grandeur the only deity to which I have paid my adorations. If I have
persecuted the protestants of my kingdom, â€™twas not because I thought
their perswasions worse than the <i>Romish</i>, but because I lookâ€™d upon
them as a sort of dangerous, antimonarchical people; who, as they had
fixed the crown upon my head, so they might as easily take it off, to
serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_39">{39}</a></span> their own party; and because by that means I securâ€™d the
<i>Jesuits</i>, who must be ownâ€™d the best supporters of arbitrary power.
Nay, to tell you the truth, my design in making you, by my emissaries, a
stickler of popery, was only to create jealousies betwixt you and your
people, so that ye might stand in need of my assistance, and be
tributary to my power. I am sorry you are in the company of the three
persons you mention. To get rid of their teasing and reproaching
conversation, I advise you to propose a match at whisk, and if by
casting knaves you can but get <i>Machiavel</i> on your side, I am sure you
will get the better of the other two. Since you mention my owning the
prince your son as king of <i>Great Britain</i>, I must needs tell you, that
neither he nor you, have reason to be beholden to me for it; for what I
did was not to keep my promise to you, but only to serve my own ends; I
considered, that an alliance being made between the <i>English</i>, the
<i>Emperor</i>, and the <i>Dutch</i>, in order to reduce my exorbitant power, a
war must inevitably follow. Now, I suppose, that after two or three
years fighting, my finances will be pretty near exhausted, and that I
shall be forced to condescend to give peace to <i>Europe</i>, as I did four
years ago. The <i>Emperor</i>, I reckon, will be brought to sign and seal
upon reasonable terms, and be content with having some small share in
the <i>Spanist</i> monarchy, as will the <i>Dutch</i> also with a barrier in
<i>Flanders</i>. These two less considerable enemies being quieted, how shall
I pacify those I fear most, I mean the <i>English</i>? Why, by turning your
dear son out of my kingdom, as I formerly did you and your brother. Not
that I will wholly abandon him neither: no, you may rest assured that I
will re-espouse his quarrel, as soon as I shall find an opportunity to
make him instrumental to the advancement of my greatness. I am obliged
to cardinal <i>Richlieu</i> for the concern he shews for the honour of
<i>France</i>, and will not fail to make use of his advice, as far as my
running cash will let me. But I am somewhat puzzled how to manage
matters in <i>England</i> at the next sessions; for my agent <i>P&#8212;&#8212;n</i>, by
taking his leave in a publick tavern, of three of our best friends, has
renderâ€™d them suspected to the nation, and consequently useless to me. I
wish you could direct me to some trusty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_40">{40}</a></span> <i>Jacobite</i> in <i>England</i>, to
distribute my bribes; for I find my own subjects unqualifyâ€™d for that
office, and easily bubbled by the sharp mercenary <i>English</i>. However, I
will not so much depend upon my <i>Lewis dâ€™ors</i>, as to disband my armies,
and lay up my fleets, as you and cardinal <i>Richlieu</i> seem to counsel me
to do. I suppose you have no other intelligence but the
<i>London-Gazette</i>, else you would not entertain so despicable an opinion
of my arms in <i>Italy</i>. I send you here enclosâ€™d a collection of the
<i>Gazettes</i> printed this year in my good city of <i>Paris</i>, whereby you
will find, upon a right computation, that the <i>Germans</i> have lost ten
men to one of the confederates. Pray fail not sending me by the next
post, all the instructions you can think of, in relation to <i>England</i>:
for thoâ€™ you made more false steps in this world, than any of your
predecessors; yet I find by your letter, you have wonderfully improvâ€™d
your politicks by the conversation of <i>Machiavel</i> and <i>Richlieu</i>. I have
communicated your letter to your dear spouse and beloved son, who cannot
be perswaded to believe it came from you; not thinking it possible that
so religious a man, whilst living, should turn libertine after his
death: I cannot, with safety, comply to your desire of disabusing the
world, concerning the miraculous cure pretended to be wrought by your
body at the <i>Benedictines</i> church. Such pious frauds being the main prop
of the Popish religion; as this is of my sovereign authority. Your son
may hope to be one day seated on your throne, not by turning Protestant
(to which he is entirely averse, and which I shall be sure to prevent)
but by the <i>superiority</i> of my arms, and the <i>extensiveness</i> of my
<i>power</i>, after I shall have fixâ€™d my son on the monarchy of <i>Spain</i>.
Madam <i>Maintenon</i> desires to be remembred to you, she writes by this
post to Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, her former husband, to desire him to wait on you,
and endeavour to divert your melancholy thoughts, by reading to you the
third part of his comical romance, which we are informâ€™d he has lately
written, for the entertainment of the dead. I remain as faithfully as
ever,</p>

<p><i>Worthy and Right Well-beloved</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HAT you may not wonder at an address from hell, or be scandalizâ€™d at
the correspondence, I must let you know first, that by the uncertainty
of the road, and the forgetfulness of my old acquaintance, all my former
letters are either miscarried, or have been neglected by my
correspondents, who, thoâ€™ they were fond enough of my scandal, nay,
courted my favours when living, now I am past gratifying their vices,
like true men, they think no more of me. The conscious tub-tavern can
witness, and my <i>Berry-street</i> apartment testify the sollicitations I
have had, for the first copy of a new lampoon, from the greatest lords
of the court; thoâ€™ their own folly, and their wives vices were the
subject. My person was so sacred, that the terrible scan-man had no
terrors for me, whose business was so publick and so useful, as
conveying about the faults of the great and the fair; for in my books
the lord was shewn a knave or fool, thoâ€™ his power defended the former,
and his pride would not see the latter. The antiquitated coquet was told
of her age and ugliness, thoâ€™ her vanity placâ€™d her in the first row in
the kingâ€™s box at the play-house, and in the view of the congregation at
St. <i>James</i>â€™s church. The precise countess that wouâ€™d be scandalizâ€™d at
a double <i>entendre</i>, was shewn betwixt a pair of sheets with a well made
footman, in spite of her quality and conjugal vow. The formal statesman
that set up for wisdom and honesty, was exposed as a dull tool, and yet
a knave, losing at play his own revenue, and the bribes incident to his
post, besides enjoying the infamy of a poor and fruitless knavery
without any concern. The demure lady, that wouâ€™d scarce sip off the
glass in company, carousing her bottles in private, of cool <i>Nantz</i> too,
sometimes to correct the crudities of her last nightâ€™s debauch. In
short, in my books were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_42">{42}</a></span> seen men and women as they were, not as they
wouâ€™d seem; strippâ€™d of their hypocrisy, spoilâ€™d of their fig-leaves of
their quality. A knave was a callâ€™d a knave, a fool a fool, a jilt a
jilt, and a whore a whore. And the love of scandal and native malice
that men and women have to one another, made me in such request when
alive, that I was admitted to the lordâ€™s closet, when a man of letters
and merit would be thrust out of doors. And I was as familiar with the
ladies as their lap-dogs; for to them I did often good services, under a
pretence of a lampoon, I conveying a <i>Billet-deux</i>; and so whilst I
exposâ€™d their past vices in the present, I prompted matter for the next
lampoon. After all these services, believe me, Sir, I was no sooner
dead, than forgotten: I have writ many letters to the bribâ€™d countries,
of their fore-runnerâ€™s arrival in these parts, but not one word of
answer. I sent word to my lord <i>Squeezall</i> that his good friend Sir
<i>Parcimony Spareall</i> was newly arrivâ€™d, and clappâ€™d into the bilbows for
a fool as well as a knave, that starvâ€™d himself to supply the
prodigality of his heirs. But he despises good counsel I hear, and
starves both himself and his children, to raise them portions. I writ
another letter to my lady <i>Manishim</i>, that virtuous Mrs. <i>Vizoe</i> was
brought in here, and made shroving-fritters for the hackney devils, for
her unnatural lusts; but <i>Sue Frousy</i> that came hither the other day,
assures me, that she either received not my letter, or at least took no
notice of it; for that she went on in her old road, and had brought her
vice almost into fashion; and that the practical vices of the town
bounded an eternal breach betwixt the sexes, while each confinâ€™d itself
to the same sex, and so threatenâ€™d a cessation of commerce in
propagation betwixt them. In short, Sir, I have tired my self with
advices to my <i>quondam</i> acquaintance, and that should take away your
surprise at my sending to you, who must be honest, because you are so
poor; and a man of merit because you were never promoted; for your world
of the theatre, is the true picture of the greater world, where honesty
and merit starve, while knavery and impudence get favour from all men.
For you, Sir, if I mistake not, are one of the most ancient of his
majestyâ€™s servants, under the denomination of a player, and yet cannot
advance above<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_43">{43}</a></span> the delivering of a scurvy message, which the strutting
leaders of your house wouâ€™d do much more aukwardly, and by consequence
â€™tis the partiality of them, or the town, that have kept you in this low
post all this while. This perswades me, that from you I may hope a true
and sincere account of things, and how matters are now carried above;
for lying, hypocrisy, and compliment, so take up all that taste of
fortuneâ€™s favour, that there is scarce any credit to be given to their
narrations; for either out of favour or malice, they give a false face
to histories, and misrepresent mankind to that abominable degree, that
the best history is not much better than a probable romance; and
<i>Quintus Curtius</i>, and <i>Calprenede</i>, are distinguished more by their
language than sincerity. Thus much by shewing the motive of my writing
to you, to take away your surprise; thoâ€™, before I pass, to remove the
shame of such a correspondence, I must tell you, that your station
qualifying you for a right information of the scandal of the town, I
hope you will not fail to answer my expectation: Behind your scenes come
all the young wits, and all the young and old beaus, both animals of
malice, and wouâ€™d no more conceal any womanâ€™s frailty, or any manâ€™s
folly, than they will own any manâ€™s sense, or any womanâ€™s honesty.</p>

<p>I know that hell lies under some disadvantages, in the opinion even of
those who are industrious enough to secure themselves a retreat here.
They play the devil among you, and yet are ashamed of their master, and
rail at his abode, as much as if they had no right to the inheritance.
The miser, whose daily toils, and nightly cares and study is how to
oppress the poor, cheat or overreach his neighbour, to betray the trusts
his hypocrisy procured; and, in short, to break all the positive laws of
morality, cries out, <i>Oh diabolical!</i> at a poor harmless double meaning
in a play, and blesses himself that he is not one of the ungodly; rails
at Hell and the Devil all the while he is riding post to them. The holy
sister, that sacrifices in the righteousness of her spirit the
reputation of some of her acquaintance or other every day; that cuckolds
her husband in the fear of the Lord with one of the elect; rails at the
whore of <i>Babylon</i>, and lawn-sleeves, as the diabolical invention of
<i>Lucifer</i>, thoâ€™ she is laying up<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_44">{44}</a></span> provisions here for a long abode in
these shades of reverend <i>Satan</i>, whom she so much all her life declaims
against. The lawyer that has watched whole nights, and bawlâ€™d away whole
days in bad causes, for good gold; that never carâ€™d how crafty his
clientâ€™s title was, if his bags were full; that has made a hundred
conveyances with flaws, to beget law-suits, and litigious broils; when
heâ€™s with the Devil, has the detestation of Hell and the Devil in his
mouth, all the while that the love of them fills his whole heart; and so
throâ€™ the rest of our false brothers, whose mouths bely their minds, and
fix an infamy on what they most pursue.</p>

<p>This is what may make you ashamed of my correspondence, but when you
will reflect on what good company we keep here, you will think it more
an honour than disgrace; for our company here is chiefly composed of
princes, great lords, modern statesmen, courtiers, lawyers, judges,
doctors of divinity, and doctors of the civil-law, beaux, ladies of
beauty and quality, wits of title, men of noisy honour, gifted brothers,
boasters of the spirits supplyâ€™d them from hence: In short, all that
make most noise against us: which will, I hope, satisfy you so far, as
to make me happy in a speedy answer; which will oblige,</p>

<p><i>Worthy Sir, of venerable Memory.</i></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OURS I received, and have been so far from being surprizâ€™d at, or
ashamâ€™d of your correspondence, that the first I desired, and the latter
was transported with. My mind has been long burdened, and I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_45">{45}</a></span> such
a correspondence to disclose my grievances to, for there is no man on
earth that wouâ€™d give me the hearing, for Popery makes a man of the best
parts a jest, and every fool with a feather in his cap, can overlook a
man of merit in rags. Wit from one out at heels, sounds like nonsense in
the ears of a gay fop, that knows no other furniture of a head, but a
full wig; and he that would split himself with the half jest of a lord
he wouâ€™d flatter, is deaf to the best thing from the mouth, of a poor
fellow he canâ€™t get by. These considerations, Sir, have made me proud of
this occasion, of replying to your obliging letter, in the manner you
desire. For as scandal was your occupation here above, you, like
vintners and bawds, living on the sins of the times; so a short
impartial account of the present state of iniquity and folly, cannot be
disagreeable to you.</p>

<p>Poetry was the vehicle that conveyed all your scandal to the town, and I
being conversant about the skirts of that art, my scandal must dwell
chiefly thereabouts; not omitting that scantling of general scandal of
the town, that is come to my knowledge; for you must know, since your
death, and your successor <i>Summerton</i>â€™s madness, lampoon has felt a very
sensible decay, and seldom is there any attempt at it, and when there
is, â€™tis very heavy and dull, cursed verse, or worse prose: so gone is
the brisk spirit of verse, that usâ€™d to watch the follies and vice of
the men and women of figure, that they could not start new ones faster
than lampoons exposâ€™d them. This deficiency of satire is not from a
scarcity of vices, which abound more than ever, or follies more numerous
than in your time, but from a meer impotence of malice, which thoâ€™ as
general as ever, confines itself to discourse; and railing is its utmost
effort, defaming over one bottle, those they caress over another. Every
man abuses his friend behind his back, and no man ever takes notice of
it, but does the same thing in his turn: And for sincerity, women have
as much: the women grow greater hypocrites than ever, lewder in their
chamber practice, and more formal in publick; they rail at the vices
they indulge; they forsake publick diversions, as plays, <i>&amp;c.</i> to gain
the reputation of virtue, to give a greater loose to the domestick
diversions of a bottle and gallant; and hypocrisy heightens their
pleasures. The mode now is not as of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">{46}</a></span> old, in all amorous encounters,
every man to his woman, but like nuns in a cloyster, every female has
her <i>privado</i> of her own sex; and the honester part of men, must either
fall in with the modish vice, or live chastly; to both which I find a
great many extreamly averse. There has a terrible enemy arose to the
stage, an abdicate divine, who when he had escaped the pillory for
sedition, and reforming the state, set up for the reformation of the
stage. The event was admirable, fanaticks presented the nonjuror, and
misers and extortioners gave him bountiful rewards: one grave citizen,
that had found the character too often on the stage, and famous for the
ruin of some hundreds of poor under-tradesmenâ€™s families, laid out
threescore pounds in the impression, to distribute among the saints,
that are zealous for God and mammon at the same time: Bullies and
republicans quarrellâ€™d for the <i>passive obedience</i> spark; grave divines
extollâ€™d his wit, and atheists his religion; the fanaticks his honesty,
the hypocrite his zeal, and the ladies were of his side, because he was
<i>for submitting to force</i>. There is yet a greater mischief befallâ€™n the
stage; here are societies set up for <i>reformation of manners</i>; troops of
<i>informers</i>, who are maintainâ€™d by perjury, serve God for gain, and
ferret out whores for subsistence. This noble society consists of
divines of both churches, fanatick as well as orthodox saints and
sinners, knights of the post, and knights of the elbow, and they are not
more unanimous against immorality in their informations, than for it in
their practice; they avoid no sins in themselves, and will suffer none
in any one else. The fanaticks, that never preached up morality in their
pulpits, or knew it in their dealings, would seem to promote it in the
ungodly. The churchmen, that would enjoy the pleasure of sinners, and
the reputation of saints, are for punishing whores and drinking in all
but themselves. In short, the motive that carries the Popish apostles to
the richer continents, makes these gentlemen so busy in our reformation
money. Nay, reformation is grown a staple commodity, and the dealers in
it are suddenly to be made into a corporation, and their privileges
peculiar are to be perjury without punishment, and lying with impunity.
The whores have a tax laid on them towards their maintenance, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_47">{47}</a></span>in which
they share with captain <i>W</i>&#8212;&#8212;, and the justices of the peace; for
<i>New-Prison</i> knows them in all their turns, and twenty or thirty
shillings gives them a license for whoring, till next pay-day; so that
the effect of their punishment only raising the price of the sin, and
the vices of the nation maintain the informers. Drinking, swearing and
whoring are the manufactures they deal in; for should they stretch their
zeal to <i>cozening, cheating, injury, extortion, oppression, defamation,
secret adulteries, and fornication</i>, and a thousand other of these more
crying immoralities, the city would rise against these invaders of their
liberties, and the cuckolds one and all, for their own and their wives
sakes, rise against the reformers. These worthy gentlemen, for promoting
the interest of the <i>Crown Office</i>, and some such honest place, pick
harmless words out of plays, to indict the players and squeeze twenty
pound a week out of them, if they can, for their exposing pride, vanity,
hypocrisy, usury, oppression, cheating, and the other darling vices of
the master reformers, who owe them a grudge, not to be appeasâ€™d without
considerable offerings; for money in these cases wipes off all defects.</p>

<p>There are other matters of smaller importance, I shall refer to my next,
as who kisses who in our dominions; that hypocrisy has infected the
stage too, where whores with great bellies would thrust themselves off
for virgins, and bully the audience out of their sight and
understanding; where maids can talk bawdy for wit, and footmen pass on
quality for gentlemen; fools sit as judges on wit, and the ignorant on
men of learning; where the motto is <i>Vivitur Ingenio</i>, the dull rogues
have the management and the profits; where farce is a darling, and good
sense and good writing not understood: and this brings to my mind a
thing I lately heard from a false smatterer in poetry behind the scenes,
and which if you see <i>Ben. Johnson</i>, I desire you to communicate to him.
A new author, says one, that has wrote a taking play, is writing <i>a
treatise of Comedy, in which he mauls the learned rogues, the writers,
to some purpose</i>; he shews what a coxcomb <i>Aristotle</i> was, and what a
company of senseless pedants the <i>Scaligers</i>, <i>Rapins</i>, <i>Vossi</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
are; proves that no good play can be regular, and that all rules are as
ridiculous as useless. He tells us, <i>Aristotle</i> knew nothing of poetry,
(for he knew nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span> of his fragments so extollâ€™d by <i>Scaliger</i>) and
that common sense and nature was not the same in <i>Athens</i> as in
<i>Drury-lane</i>; that uniformity and coherence was <i>green-sleeves</i> and
<i>pudding-pies</i>, and that irregularity and nonsense were the chief
perfections of the <i>drama</i>. That the <i>Silent Woman</i>, by consequence was
before the <i>Trip to the Jubilee</i>, and the <i>Ambitious Step-Mother</i>,
better than the <i>Orphan</i>; that <i>hiccius doctius</i> was <i>Arabick</i>, and that
<i>Bonnyclabber</i> is the <i>black broth</i> of the <i>LacedÃ¦monians</i>; and thus he
runs on with paradoxes as new as unintelligible; but this noble treatise
being yet in embryo, you may expect a farther account of it in the next,

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU will be surprizâ€™d, I know, to receive this letter from a stranger;
and of all the damnâ€™d, perhaps, I am the only man from whom you least of
all expect any news; because I have always passed for so impious and
cruel a prince, and my name has given people such horrid ideas of me,
that they think me insensible of pity, as having never practised any in
my life-time.</p>

<p>When I sat upon the throne of <i>Syria</i>, having no more religion than your
<i>Most Christian Majesty</i>, I stifled all the dictates of my conscience,
pillaged the temple of the <i>Jews</i>, caroused with their blood, and
running from one crime to another, drew infinite desolations every where
after me. But after I had exercised my tyranny on the innocent posterity
of several great kings, and left a thousand monuments of my barbarity, I
found to my sorrow, that I was mortal, and obliged to submit to that
fare, whose attacks feeble nature cannot resist. I then fell into an
abyss, which is enlightened only by those flames which will for ever
roast such monsters as we; and where I was loaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span> with heavier irons
than any I had plaguâ€™d poor mortals with above. To welcome me into this
place of horror, and refresh me after my voyage, I was plungâ€™d into a
bath of fire and brimstone, cuppâ€™d by a Master-devil, rubbâ€™d, scrubbâ€™d,
<i>&amp;c.</i> by a parcel of smoaking, grinning hobgobblins, and afterwards
presented with a musical entertainment of groans, howling, and gnashing
of teeth. I soon began to play my part in this hideous consort, where
despair beat the measure; and because my pains were infinitely greater
than those of others, I immediately asked the reason of my torments, and
was told it was for having hindered the peopling of Hell, by the
multitude of martyrs my long persecutions had made, and of which you
cannot be ignorant, if you delight in useful reading. Since I have been
in this empire of sorrow, where I found the <i>Pharaohs</i>, <i>Ahabs</i>,
<i>Jezebels</i>, <i>Athaliahs</i>, <i>Nebuchadnezzars</i>, &amp;c. and where I have seen
arrive the <i>Neroes</i>, <i>Dioclesians</i>, <i>Decii</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Philips of Austria</i>,
<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>Charles of Valois</i>, whose names would fill a volume; the recruits
of <i>Loyola</i> arrive every day in search of their captain, but in some
confusion, for fear of meeting <i>Clement</i> and <i>Ravillac</i>, who never cease
cursing them. Your apartments, <i>Most Christian Hero</i>, has been some
fifty years a rearing, but now they redouble their care, your coming
being daily expected; I give you timely notice of it, that you may take
your measures accordingly. Perhaps you will be offended at this
familiarity, and tell me no man can deserve hell for fighting against
hereticks, under the command of an infallible general; but if you know
the present state of those miterâ€™d leaders, it would not a little
terrify you. <i>Lucifer</i> has turned them into several shapes, and peoplâ€™d
his back yard with them; the place â€™tis true, is not so delightful as
your <i>Menagerie</i> and <i>Trianon</i> at <i>Versailles</i>, but much excels it in
variety and number of monsters. Your cell is in the same yard, that you
may be near your good friends, who advisâ€™d you to make the habitation of
the shades a desart; for which the prince of darkness hates you
mortally, and designs you something worse than a fistula, or the bull of
<i>Phalaris</i>. Your ingenious emissaries, <i>Marillac</i>, <i>la Rapine</i>, and <i>la
Chaise</i>, will meet in the squadrons of <i>Pluto</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_50">{50}</a></span> with more invenomâ€™d
dragoons, than those they let loose against their poor countrymen in
<i>France</i>: â€™twill be their employment to keep this <i>Menagerie</i> clean,
whose stench would otherwise poison the rest of hell. That renegado
<i>Pelisson</i> too makes so odious a figure here, that he frights the
boldest of our jaylors; and his eyes, red with crying for his sins,
which were so much the greater, because they were voluntary, make him
ashamâ€™d to look anyone in the face. Our learned think him profoundly
ignorant; yet you must be the <i>Trajan</i> of that <i>Pliny</i>, for he is now
writing your history in such a terrible manner, that it will but little
resemble that which your pensionary wits are composing. The voyage
having made him lose some part of his memory, and forget the particulars
of your virtues; he will therefore take me for his model, and draw my
life under your name. Thoâ€™ your dear <a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>Dulcinea</i>, whose head he
dresses like a girlâ€™s, at the age of threescore and ten, makes the court
of <i>Proserpine</i> rejoice before-hand; yet the deformed <a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> author of the
comical romance, cannot laugh, as facetious as he is; I will tell you no
more, because some may think I give this counsel out of my private
interest; for having been always ambitious, it would doubtless grieve me
to see a more wicked and cruel tyrant than myself; but on the faith and
word of one that endures the sharpest of torments, â€™tis pure compassion.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Just now receivâ€™d yourâ€™s by a courier, who, had he not been too nimble
for me, had been rewarded according to his deserts for his impudent
message. But are you such a coxcomb as to imagine that the most
ambitious monarch upon earth, whose power puts all the princes and
states of <i>Europe</i> into convulsions, can be frighted at the threats of a
wretch condemnâ€™d to everlasting punishments? The insolence of your
comparison, I must confess, threw me into a rage: and not reflecting at
first on the impossi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_51">{51}</a></span>bility of the thing, I sent immediately for
<i>Boufflers</i> to dragoon you. But, villain! because your malice has been
rampant for so many ages, must you now level it at the eldest son of the
church, whom the godly <i>Jesuits</i> have already canonizâ€™d? I am not so
ignorant of the history of <i>Asia</i>, thoâ€™ I never read any of the books of
the <i>Maccabees</i>; but I know you were both judge and executioner, and
that there is not in the universe one monument consecrated to your
glory. Thanks to the careful <i>Jesuits</i>, <i>la place des victoris</i>, is a
sufficient proof that my reputation is no <i>chimera</i>, and my name, which
is to be seen in golden characters over several monasteries, assures me
of a glorious immortality. â€™Tis true, to keep in favour with the church,
I have compellâ€™d a handful of obstinate fools to leave their country and
estates, by forcing them to renounce their God, and implicitly take up
with mine. Therefore the world has no reason to make such a noise about
it. Are you mad to call <i>Pelisson</i>, who has read more volumes than a
<i>rabbi</i>, and couâ€™d give lessons of hypocrisy to the most exquisite sect
of the <i>Pharisees</i>, a block-head? Your torments are so great, you know
not on whom to spit your venom, and my poor <a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> mistress, forsooth, must
suffer from your malice: Is she the worse for being born in the reign of
my grandfather? Pray ask <i>Boileau</i>, whose sincerity has cost him many a
tear, what he thinks of her. All the world knows her virtues, and that
she is grown grey in the school of dissimulation and lewdness, which
have renderâ€™d her so charming in the feats of love, that she pleases me
more than the youngest beauty; therefore are her wrinkles the objects of
my wonder, and the provocatives of my enervated limbs, instead of being
antidotes; and I would not give a saint a wax-candle to make her
younger. Thoâ€™ I am seizâ€™d by a cancer on the shoulder, yet I am under no
apprehensions, for I have given a fee to St. <i>Damian</i>, who will cure me
of it, as well as of that nauseous malady of <i>Naples</i>: And I have
plenipotentiaries now bribing heaven for its friendship, and a new term
of years. Then â€™tis in vain for <i>Lucifer</i>, or you, ever to expect me;
and when I must leave this terrestial <i>paradice</i>, â€™twill be with such a
convoy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_52">{52}</a></span> <i>Masses</i>, as will hurry me by the very gate of <i>Purgatory</i>,
without touching there. In the mean time correct your saucy liberty, and

art for his pimp, still huff the world, and sleep quietly in his

<h2><a id="Catharine_de_Medicis_to_the_Duchess_of_Orleans"></a><span class="smcap">Catharine</span> de Medicis, <i>to the Duchess of</i> <span class="smcap">Orleans</span>.</h2>

<p><i>Madam</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Have long bewailed your condition, and thoâ€™ I am in a place of horror,
yet I should think myself in some measure happy, if I knew how to
deliver you from those anxieties which torment you. We have some body or
other arrives here daily from <i>Versailles</i>, and as my curiosity inclines
me to enquire after your highness, I have received so advantageous a
character of your goodness from all hands, that I think every one ought
to pity you. Your life, madam, has been very unhappy, for you were
married very young to a jealous ill-naturâ€™d prince, who had no love for
you; thoâ€™ no person in the world was fitter either to inspire or receive
it than yourself: However, you have had better luck than his former
wife, which I take to be owing to your prudence, and not his generosity.
The desolations of the <i>Palatine</i>, and persecution of a religion you
once approved, must infallibly have given you many uneasy moments, but
your misfortunes did not stop here, for even your domestick pleasures
have been poisonâ€™d by the dishonour and injustice of the court you live
in. In short, thoâ€™ I was very unfortunate, yet I think you much more
worthy of compassion: When I married <i>Henry</i> II. I was both young and
handsome, yet his doting on the haughty duchess of <i>Valentinois</i>, who
was a grandmother before <i>Francis</i> II. was born, made me pass many
melancholy nights. Notwithstanding the injustice as well as cruelty of
keeping a saucy strumpet under my nose, yet with the veil of prudence
and religion, I easily covered my inclinations, because the pious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_53">{53}</a></span>
cardinal of <i>Lorrain</i>, who had an admirable talent to comfort an
afflicted heart, commiserating my condition, gave me wonderful
consolation. As the refreshing cordials of the church soon made me
forget the kingâ€™s ill usage of me; so, madam, it is not so much the
infidelity of your husband, as the cruel constraint and jealousy, that
makes me think your life to be miserable; for how great soever your
occasions are, you dare not I know, accept of those assistances, I daily
receive from a plump agreeable prelate, and I am heartily sorry for it.
To divert this discourse, which may perhaps aggravate your uneasiness,
by renewing your necessities, youâ€™ll tell me, I suppose, that I shouâ€™d
have had as much compassion, when <i>France</i> was dyâ€™d with the blood of so
many thousand victims, and that I might easily have moderated the fury
of my son, and of the house of <i>Guise</i>; but besides, you must consider,
I was a zealous Papist; and they, you know, think the cutting of poor
hereticks throats is doing heaven good service; so that I beheld the
dreadful massacre of St. <i>Bartholomew</i> with as much satisfaction as ever
I did the most glorious and solemn festival. I am not for it at present,
madam, and could I have been so sooner, it would have been much more for
my ease. All my comfort is, that I am not by myself in a strange and
unknown country: for the old duchess, who robbed me of my due
benevolence in the other world, continually follows me to upbraid me;
the <i>Guises</i> rave, brandishing bloody daggers in their hands; and every
hour I meet with numbers of my former acquaintance and nearest
relations, but I avoid their company as much as I can, for the love of
my dear cardinal, who continues as great a gallant as ever. I ask no
masses of you, for the dead are not a farthing the better for them. But,
madam, since all the world has not so good an opinion of me at
<i>Brantome</i>, let me conjure you not to let my memory be too much
insulted. Some may say I was as cunning as <i>Livia</i>, that I was even with
my husband, and governâ€™d my children; but their fate did not answer my
care: For <i>Francis</i> livâ€™d but a little time, <i>Elizabeth</i> found her tomb
in the arms of a jealous husband, the queen of <i>Navarre</i> was a wandering
star, <i>Charles</i> a cautious coxcomb, that sacrificed all to his safety;
and <i>Henry</i>, on whom I had founded all my hopes, a dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span>solute debauchee,
whom the justice of heaven would not spare. You know his history, and if
you shouâ€™d see a tragedy, of the like nature acted on your stage, let
your constancy, which makes you respected even in hell, support you. Let
old <a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>Messalina</i> enjoy the famous honour of the royal bed; you need
not blush at it, since all the world esteems you as much as they.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">â€™T</span>WAS with much reason you pity me; and thoâ€™ I have said nothing all
this while, yet I have not thought the less. If the practice of our
court did not teach me to dissemble, I should give myself some ease, by
imparting many things to you, which would fill you with horror; and then
you would find that the cruelties of your sons were trifles in
comparison of these. The most impartial censurers of barbarity maintain
that the massacre of St. <i>Bartholomew</i> was milder than the present
persecution of the Protestants: Ambition was the chiefest motive of the
<i>Guises</i>; but now their cruelties are covered with the cloak of
religion; for the virtuous favourite <a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> <i>Sultaness</i>, with the pitious
<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> <i>Mufti</i> in waiting, are resolved to cause the christians to be more
cruelly persecuted than they were at <i>Algiers</i>, and the <i>Roman church</i>
is resolved, at any rate, to merit the name of the blood-thirsty beast.
They value not exposing the reputation of princes; I blush for my race,
and am often obliged to swallow my tears. I believe the efficacy of
masses no more than you, therefore I will not offer you any. I am very
glad to hear the cardinal of <i>Lorrain</i> proves so constant; for a prelate
of his talent and constitution must certainly be a great consolation to
a distressed princess. <i>Brantome</i> who has so much flatterâ€™d you, may do
it again; and thoâ€™ <i>Sancy</i> has been too sincere, yet he dares not
contradict him in your presence. I hope to see the ruins of my country
raisâ€™d up again; for thoâ€™ our ambitious monarch huffs and hectors<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_55">{55}</a></span> all
Christendom, yet his game to me seems very desperate, and I believe
heâ€™ll prove the dog in the fable; since he has so depopulated and
impoverishâ€™d his dominions by persecutions, that those pious drones the
<i>Monks</i>, only can support the churchâ€™s grandeur in their faces, with
three story-chains; the rest of his people being reducâ€™d to wooden-shoes
and garlick. Thoâ€™ our <i>Gazettes</i> are little better than romances, yet
they will serve to divert you and your cardinal, when not better
employâ€™d; and I wish I could send them to you weekly. â€™Tis true, great
numbers set out daily from hence, for your country; and among them,
people of the best quality, but I carefully avoid all commerce with
them; and thoâ€™ I have a wonderful esteem for you, take it not amiss,
madam, if I endeavour never to see you.</p>

the tenderness of a father, who was always under my subjection, and
wouâ€™d have married my niece, if I had pleasâ€™d. I fell into a cold sweat
even in the midst of my fire and brimstone, at the news of your<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span>
conspiracy; because it so severely reflected on his reputation. Ought
you to have exposed his credit in so dubious an enterprize? Is it not
sufficient that poets set upon him <a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <i>Mont Pagnotte</i>, whilst other
princes gave glorious examples at the head of their troops? That they
reproach him with incest, sodomy, adultery, and an unbridled passion for
the relict of a poor <a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> poet, who is a turn-spit here below, and who
had nothing to keep him from starving when upon earth, but the pension
which the charity of <i>Anne of Austria</i> granted to his infirmities,
rather than his works, thoâ€™ very diverting. What was your aim in this
cowardly design? wouâ€™d you have more servants, and more whores? Or,
ought you to effect that, to revive those scenes of cruelty and
treachery which we banishâ€™d after the death of the most eminent cardinal
<i>Richlieu</i>? All the wealth you can raise, will never amount to the
treasures I was master of; and how much is there now left, ask the duke
of <i>Mazarine</i>, and my nephew of <i>Nevers</i>; one has been the bubble of the
priests, and the other of his pleasures. So that the children of the
first will hardly share one year of my revenue. His wife for several
years was no charge to him, she for her beauty, being kept by strangers;
whilst he foolâ€™d away those vast riches he had by her. In short, you see
the praying coxcomb I made choice of, which, I must confess, I did when
I was in my cups, has throâ€™ his zeal and bigotry ruinâ€™d all, even my
most beautiful statues; and that there is a curse entailâ€™d upon such
estates as begin with a miracle, and end with a prodigy. I was born at
<i>Mazare</i>, without any other advantage than that of my beauty; but as a
young fellow can scarce desire a better portion than that, in <i>Italy</i>,
so it movâ€™d cardinal <i>Anthony</i> to lead me lovingly from his chamber to
his closet, where on a soft easy couch, he preachâ€™d to me morals after
the <i>Italian</i> fashion; by which, and some other virtuous actions of the
same stamp, I became the richest favourite in the universe. You may as
well as I, heap a mighty treasure, and lose it foolishly. Do not be
guilty then of murder, for things so uncertain in the possession. Poor
<i>Louvois</i>! who left you all, who drank more than <i>Alexander</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_57">{57}</a></span>
thievâ€™d better than <i>Colbert</i>, or I, has not now water to quench his
thirst. You will undoubtedly meet the same destiny; for this is the
residence of traitors, murtherers, thieves, and all other notorious
villains. â€™Tis not altogether so pleasant a place as <a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> <i>Meudon</i> and
<i>Chaville</i>; for we drink nothing but <i>Aqua-fortis</i>, and eat burning
<i>charcoal</i>; all happiness is banishâ€™d, misery only triumphs; and
notwithstanding all those lying stories the priests may tell you, yet

plundering, must it therefore prescribe to mine? And do you think the

deserves less immortality, than of ruining of his subjects? You have, I
confess, very meritoriously eternizâ€™d your name by that method, for
which reason you ought in conscience to allow me the liberty to find out
another. You are much in the wrong onâ€™t, to complain of the duke of

ought not to be surprised, if I am not now dispossessed of it. I had not
long troubled the world before my mother <a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was divorced, and I myself
declared incapable of succeeding <i>Henry</i> VIII. <i>Anne Boleyn</i> was then
brought to the royal bed; and what was worse, with her was introduced a
religion so conformable to the laws of God, that it never suited with my
inclinations. The proud rival of <i>Catherine</i>, was afterwards sacrificâ€™d
to the inconstancy of her voluptuous husband; but that insipid religion,
to my grief, was not confounded with her; for the young and simple
<i>Edward</i> countenanced it during his reign. But then came my turn, and
you know, sovereign pontiff, with what pride and malice I mounted the
throne; the means I used to destroy that cursed heretical doctrine; the
pleasure I took in shedding my subjects blood; what magnificence and
splendor I gave to the mass; how barbarously I treated that innocent and
beautiful princess <i>Jane Gray</i>; with what severity I used my sister
<i>Elizabeth</i>, and also the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span> immoderate joy that seized my precious soul,
when I married a prince who had, as well as I, the good quality of being
cruel to the highest degree, is not unknown to you. Notwithstanding what
I said in the beginning of my letter, you may, perhaps, think my
sentiments now altered: but I assure you the contrary, and that I cannot
behold with patience your present insensibility and mildness. Is it
possible you can suffer a religion, destitute of all ornaments, that has
nothing but truth and simplicity to recommend it, to get the advantage
of your <i>Rome</i>, which reigns in blood and purple, subsists by falshood
and idolatry, and sets up and pulls down kings? how can you endure it?
what a horrid shame and weakness is this? are there no more <i>Ravillacs</i>?
is there neither powder nor daggers, in the arsenal of the Jesuits? have
they forgot how to build wheels, gibbets, and scaffolds? or is your
malice, envy, hatred, and fury, seized with a lethargy? â€™s death! holy
father, I am distracted when I think that nothing succeeds in <i>England</i>,
where I took so much pains, and practised so much cruelty to establish
Popery, and root out the doctrine of the apostles; and where your pious
emissaries following my zeal, had invented most admirable machines to
sacrifice, with <i>James</i> I. all the enemies of your Anti-christian
Holiness. Do you sleep? and must <i>France</i> only brandish the glorious
flambeau of persecution? Consider, I pray, that I employ the best of my
time in imprecations against the deserters from your church; that I so
inflamed my blood in those transports, that it threw me into a dropsy,
which hurried me to the grave. My husband, who was too much of my temper
to love me, was very little concerned: In short, that filthy disease
stifled me, a certain presage of the continual thirst I now suffer. But
I once more beseech you, most holy father, to re-inforce your squadrons,
to join them with the Most Christian Kingâ€™s, and, with your holy
benediction, give them strict orders to grant no quarters to the
disciples of St. <i>Paul</i>. You will infinitely oblige by it both me and
<i>Lucifer</i>, who is now as zealous a <i>Romanist</i> as your <i>eldest son</i>, and
who, like him, would not willingly suffer any but good Papists, the
friends and pensioners of <i>Versailles</i>, those sworn enemies of liberty
and property, in his dominions. I am so ill-naturâ€™d, that my husband
<i>Philip</i> is as cautious of em<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_60">{60}</a></span>bracing me, as he was in the other world;
but thatâ€™s no misfortune either to Earth or Hell, for we could produce
nothing but a monster between us, which would be the terror of mankind,
and horror of devils.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU are too violent, dear madam, and men of my age and grandeur require
more moderation. I am acquainted with your history, and know your zeal;
by the same token, you need not waste your lungs to acquaint me with
either the one or the other. To be free with you, I am not of the humour
to espouse madly other peoples passions, thoâ€™ I should leave the triple
crown destitute of all pomp and greatness. But I will make the hereticks
blot out of their writings, if possible, the names of <i>Antichrist</i>,
<i>devouring Dragon</i>, <i>Wolf disguisâ€™d in sheeps-skin</i>, and several others
as abusive. Do you not believe people are weary of paying a blind
obedience to the see of <i>Rome</i>? Imperious <i>France</i> has made us sensible
of it; and it is not the fault of the <i>eldest son of the Church</i>, if he
does not dethrone his mother. Ecclesiastical censures are now out of
fashion, and no more minded than pasquinades. We were scornâ€™d and
ridiculâ€™d in your fatherâ€™s time; and thoâ€™ you were as handsome as my
<i>quondam</i> mistress, <i>Donna Maria di S. Germano</i>, you would not oblige me
to put up fresh affronts for your sake. Your husband is to blame to
treat you with such indifference, and I think it very ill for an
infected worm-eaten carcase to despise so devout a queen. But I cannot
imagine why the popes, who live all under the same zone with you, suffer
such coldness. Suppose your husband should, like a heretick, despise
their exhortations, one of their decrees has power enough to divorce
you; which in time, I hope, may advance your grandeur; for we hear
<i>Pluto</i> is in love with you for your zeal, and <i>Proserpine</i> is given
over by the physicians. Therefore take my advice, and drink as little
water as you can; for being dropsical, the water of <i>Styx</i> must needs be
prejudicial to you, and the church would lose an admirable good friend.
I offer you no indulgences, they are pure mountebank drugs, and were you
got no farther yet than Purgatory, have not the virtue<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_61">{61}</a></span> to bring you
out. But grant they had that power, as your amours stand now, I suppose
you would not desire it; so, till I have the happiness of wishing your

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>INCE we were of the same trade, with this difference only, that I
composâ€™d farces to make the world laugh, and that you invent tragedies
that gave them horror: I believe, reverend father, you will not condemn
the liberty I take of writing to you.</p>

<p>In the first place, I beseech your reverence, not to put your penitents
out of conceit with those harmless diversions which make me and my
brother-players live so plentifully; but be pleased to take our small
flock into your protection: that power lies in the breast of you and
your pious society: and who wouâ€™d grudge it to such holy men, who have
no other aim than settling and satisfying menâ€™s consciences, by clearing
all the controverted difficulties of Christianity, and rendring religion
so plain and easy, that our enemies cannot find the least doubt or
difficulty in it. Nay, like a dextrous artist you can, with your
admirable morals, remove the justest scruples; for they give so pious an
air, so devout a shade to the greatest crimes, that they enchant the
world, and hide their deformity, without opposing the licentiousness of
passions, or destroying their pleasures or intention. These admirable
talents, most holy confessor, open to your society the closets and
hearts of princes, and bring all the lovers of voluptuousness and
barbarity to be your confessionaries. Truly, reverend father, your fame
is infinite, and the great St. <i>Loyola</i> may be proud of having so many
righteous disciples. But these miracles make the world believe him
something related to <i>Simon Magus</i>; for without inchantments â€™tis
impossible to do so many prodigies. The lameness in his feet, and megrim
heâ€™s daily troubled with, by being too near a hot furnace of brimstone,
makes him so peevish and out of humour, that he cannot write to any of
you; therefore look upon me as his secretary, and not a-jot the lesser
saint for having been upon the stage; all <i>Paris</i> can<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_62">{62}</a></span> witness for me,
that as soon as I laid aside my comical mask and habit, I could, upon
occasion, look as demure and devout as a fresh pardoned penitent; so
that the employment is neither above my gravity, nor I hope above my
sincerity and capacity; for I have often had the honour of shewing my
parts before his most christian majesty in his <i>seraglio</i>, to make him
more prolifick, and more disposed to the mighty work of propagation.
But, reverend father, â€™tis time now to tell you, as a good catholick and
your friend, that we are so scandalizâ€™d here at his conduct, that we
cannot believe he follows your holy advice; and were it not for this
doubt, and our sollicitations, <i>Lucifer</i> had last summer sent <i>Loyola</i>
under the command of Monsieur <i>Luxembourg</i>, to dragoon you. <i>Zounds!</i>
says he, <i>is the order that daily sent me so many subjects revolted?</i>
â€™Tis true, the rogues <i>Ravillac</i> and <i>Clement</i> have a little disgracâ€™d
you, but we donâ€™t value now what they say, for the wits have espoused
your quarrel, and blinded the eyes of detraction. Indeed it is no wonder
to us, since they sing to <i>Apollo</i>â€™s harp, which had the power to claim
the transports of <i>Jupiter</i>. Is there any thing so charming as the
discourse of <a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Ariste</i> and <i>Eugene</i>, and that little <i>Je ne sÃ§ai
quoi</i>, they speak so wittily of? Who can resist the art of good
invention in the work of wit, or an exquisite choice of good verses? And
who would not be charmâ€™d with all those panegyricks upon the ladies? Is
not once reading of them a thousand times more diverting, than those
profound writings you so prudently forbid your penitents the perusal of?
I own indeed, that this conduct is not altogether so apostolical, but
â€™tis much easier than to be always puzzling and hammering our parables.
â€™Tis certain, most reverend father, shouâ€™d you leave the sacred writ
open to all readers, it would fare with a thousand good souls, as with
king <i>Ahasuerus</i>, who became favourable to the true religion, by reading
a true chronicle, how many blind wretches think ye would see clear? How
many favourites would be hangâ€™d, and <i>Mordecai</i>â€™s raised to honour? And
how many <i>Jesuits</i> would be treated as the priests of <i>Baal</i>? But you,
Iâ€™m sure, will take care to hinder that; for tru<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_63">{63}</a></span>ly â€™twould be contrary
to your ecclesiastical prudence; and it is much safer for you to darken
the divine lights, and confound by sophisms the sacred truths of holy
writ: for what would become of your church, if the clouds were once
dispersed, since it flourishes by their favour, and the protection of
ignorance? Nothing can keep up the credit of a repudiated cheat, whose
shams are so notorious, and whole equipage so different from that of the
legitimate spouse of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, that neither he, nor any of his
faithful servants know or own her, but ignorance and falshood. I ask
your pardon, most reverend father, these expressions flow so naturally
from my subject, that they have escaped my sincerity; and I own this is
not the style of a flatterer. But to atone for my fault, I will give you
some wholsome advice, which is, <i>to make hay while the sun shines</i>, for
you must not expect much fair weather in these doleful quarters. Those
worthy gentlemen called <i>Confessors</i>, being looked upon here to be no
better than so many <i>Ignes fatui</i>, that lead their followers into
precipices; for which reason they are not allowed ice with their liquor.
This I can allure you to be true, <i>in verbo histrionis</i>: Therefore since
you know what you must trust to, I need not advise a person of your
profound parts, what measures to take. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Believe, worthy gentlemen, you are very well satisfyâ€™d that I am
damnâ€™d; and&#8212;&#8212; indeed there was little likelihood that such a monster
as myself should enjoy happiness, after having committed so much
wickedness, and taken so much pleasure in it. I took a fancy to acts of
cruelty from my very cradle, and with great fidelity servâ€™d <i>Philip</i> II.
The celebrated apostle of the <i>Gentiles</i> never made so many miserable
wretches when he was as violent a zealot of the law; I, like him, made
use of chains, racks, fire, and all that an ingenious fury couâ€™d imagine
most tormenting; but it was never any part of my destiny to be converted
at last like him. Thus I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_65">{65}</a></span> went on in my iniquities, and became the
strongest brute that bigottry ever debauchâ€™d; so that at my first
arrival to Hell, there was never a Devil of the whole pack but fell a
trembling, thoâ€™ he had been never so much accustomed to such company
before. But, gentlemen, why are you not become wise by my example? For
you must not flatter yourselves, that the difference of our professions
makes any in our crimes. You are warriors when you please; for the
monastick soldiery followâ€™d the duke of <i>Mayeney</i>â€™s standard during the
league; crowned themselves with immortal shame at the barbarous triumph
of St. <i>Bartholomew</i>; and shoulderâ€™d the musket after they had preached
those bloody sermons, which made christians treat their fellow-creatures
like beasts of prey. I confess, I never troubled my head about scruples
of conscience, and if I have not obeyed that article of the decalogue,
<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>, I never roared out with a wide mouth, as the
priests of the <i>Roman Church</i>, persecute, imprison, kill, destroy, force
them to obey. My fury came only from your brethren, who had so
thoroughly corrupted me, that I thought Heaven would be my reward, if I
butcherâ€™d all they were pleased to stigmatize with heresy. So I gave a
loose to my passions, as you may read in history, where, I think, they
have used me but too kindly. To seduce men of weak understandings is no
extraordinary matter; but that princes, who ought to have a competent
knowledge of every thing, should be cheated by you, is a miracle to me.
No age of the world ever saw a greater example of it, than in my master
<i>Philip</i>, whose natural sloth, and besotted bigottry, gave so fair a
field to these ecclesiastical impostors, so fair an opportunity to
manage him as they pleased; and his fatherâ€™s <a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> ashes are a sufficient
proof of it. Instead of setting before his eyes the example of that
invincible prince, these sanctifyâ€™d villains only plunged him deeper in
superstition and idolatry. And as a domineering lazy lord of a country
village, will never go out of his own parish, so he never travelled
farther than from <i>Madrid</i> to the <i>Escurial</i>. His wife, father, son, and
brother, felt the effects of their barbarous doctrine. And, to leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">{66}</a></span>
behind him a pious idea of his soul, when he was dying, he ordered his
crown and coffin to be set before him. This was hypocrisy with a
witness, but that is no crime in a zealot. Youâ€™ll tell me perhaps, I
direct my discourse to improper persons, who know not the history of
<i>Philip</i> of <i>Austria</i>, ignorance being common enough in those of your
fraternity, yet let me tell you, I am not mistaken; for the diabolical
spirit that now possesses you, is the very same that influenced the
priests of my time; and I may safely affirm, that <i>France</i> is the
theatre of cruelty and iniquity. Your monarch, who is much such another
saint as my master, spares the poor Protestants lives, for no other
reason, but to make, by his inhuman torments, death more desirable to
them. These, and a thousand more unjust actions does he commit, to
satiate your hellish vanity, which would for ever domineer in the city
built on seven mountains. To this you will answer, What doth it signify
if we make him persecute the Protestants, murther their kings, and keep
no faith or treaties with them, since it encreases our power, and
propagates our religion? But, gentlemen, when you come to be where I am,
you will, Iâ€™m certain, sing another tune.</p>

its enemies, by the ministry of the duke of <i>Alva</i>, and orderâ€™d my
fatherâ€™s bones to be dug out of the ground and burnt, for having
tolerated <i>Luther</i>â€™s heresy. Otherwise I should never have concernâ€™d
myself about it, supposing none but flegmatick coxcombs would espouse a
church which does not keep open house all the year round, and wonâ€™t

conqueror at <i>Levanto</i>: to balance that account with Heaven, I gave
largely to the priests, built monasteries, went to processions, was
loaded like a mule with beads and relicks, and by this means passed for
a saint. And this I think may properly enough be called a good religion.
â€™Tis true, I never saw any engagement but in my closet, or at a

of having angels, saints, and martyrs for their companions, we can brag
of having popes, cardinals, emperors, kings, queens, jesuits, monks, and

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>INCE we donâ€™t dispatch couriers every day from the kingdom of <i>Pluto</i>,
you ought not to be surprized, that I have not had an opportunity till
now, of telling you what sticks in my stomach. I thought your first
satires very admirable, your expressions just and laboriously turnâ€™d,
yet charming and natural. Were the distribution of rewards in my power,
I should certainly give you something for your <i>Art of Poetry</i>: but for
your <i>Lutrin</i>, that master-piece of your wit, that highest effort of
your imagination, I see nothing in it worthy of you, but the
verification. Every one owns you can write, nay, your very enemies allow
it; but you know a metamorphosis requires an entire change; therefore,
since you resolve to imitate <i>Virgil</i>, you should have made choice of
noble heroes. He that travestied the <i>Ã†neis</i>, understood it better than
you, and did not fatigue himself so much; and as he was a man of clear
and good sense, has judiciously remarkâ€™d, that his queen disguised like
a country-wench, is infinitely beyond your clockmakerâ€™s wife dressâ€™d
like an empress. But let us leave this subject, which now it is too late
to amend, since what is done cannot be undone. What did you mean, you I
say, who have been accused of stealing my lines, and who, to deal
honestly with you, have often followed the same road I have traced? What
did you mean, I say, by reflecting on particulars in your satire against
women: Did I ever set you that example? Is not my sixth satire against
the sex in general; and when I look back as far as the reigns of
<i>Saturn</i> and <i>Rhea</i> for <a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> modesty, do I pretend the least shadow of
it is left upon the earth? Unthinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_71">{71}</a></span> fool! those different characters
you have drawn, will make you so many particular enemies; and I
question, if the patroness you have chosen can secure you from their
claws.</p>

<p>If an affected zeal inspires you with so much veneration for a saint of

discipline himself in the face of the godly, like one of the <a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
militia of St. <i>Francis</i>, adore a golden cow, and adorn an idol each
blast of wind can overthrow, with those garlands which should be
preservâ€™d for <i>the statues of the greatest heroes</i>! She is, it is true,
very singular in her kind; but will you stain your name, of <i>illustrious
poet</i>, by creeping before a walking mummy of her superannuated
gallantry? your sordid interest has made you a traytor to <i>Satire</i>; and
thereby you occasion here continual divisions, <a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <i>Chaquelian</i> and
<i>St. Amant</i> have been at cuffs with <a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> <i>Moliere</i> and <i>Cornielle</i>,
because you have not treated them so civilly as your <a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> <i>Urgande</i>. The
two first ridicule your sordid covetous humour, and say you learnt that
baseness while you belongâ€™d to the <i>Registerâ€™s Office</i>. The other two,
who were perhaps of your trade, defend the honour of your extraction.
But <i>St. Amant</i><a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, who will never forget the unworthy character you
have given him concerning his poverty, which he swears is false; and
submitting his verses to the judgment of unprejudiced persons, for which
you ridicule him, said in a haughty tone, (which set us all a laughing)
that when he was a gentleman of the chamber in ordinary to the queen of
<i>Poland</i>, and embassador extraordinary at the coronation of the queen of
<i>Sweden</i>, he kept several footmen of better quality than yourself.
<i>Chaquelian</i>, who cannot say so much for himself, is content with
singing the terrible valour of the duke <i>de Nevers</i>â€™s lackeys, who kept
time with their cudgels on your shoulders. We were forced to call for a
bottle to appease this war; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_72">{72}</a></span> <i>St. Amant</i>, taking the glass in his
hand, swore by his maker, he had rather you had callâ€™d him drunkard than
fool, thoâ€™ he drinks very moderately in this place, where it is no great
scandal to be thirsty. Be not concerned at this paragraph, because the
rest of my letter sufficiently testifies the esteem I have for you, and
my concern for your welfare: therefore to preserve both, renounce your
sordid way of praising vice, and employ your happy talent in teaching
good manners, and correcting the bad, which will be an employment worthy
of your great genius, and is the only way to recommend you to the good
opinion of the learned ancients.</p>

<p>The four first lines, I must own, are something against the grain; and
the natural inclination I have to rail, and be thought an excellent
poet, gives my tongue the lie; but the four last, which shew more
prudence than wit, reconcile that matter. â€™Tis certainly, illustrious
bard, more difficult to please the world now than it was in your time;
for if I write satire, I am beaten for it; if I praise, I am callâ€™d a
mercenary flatterer, which so disheartens me, that I address myself now
to my Gardener only; and do not doubt but some busy nice critick will be
censuring this poem also. Not being in the best humour when I writ it,
perhaps it may appear something dark and abstruse; but I can easily
excuse that, by maintaining that â€™tis impossible for the best author in
the world to keep up always to the same strain, Have you ever heard of
the tales of the <i>Peau dâ€™Asne</i>, &amp; <i>Grisedilis</i>? if <i>Proserpine</i> had any
little children, â€™twould be a most agreeable diversion for them, and I
wouâ€™d send it â€™em for a present. Thoâ€™ that author furnishes you with
sufficient matter to laugh at me, yet I must confess he has found the
art of making something of a trifle. Every one here learns his verses by
heart; and in spight of my translation of <i>Longinus</i>, which makes it so
plainly appear, I understand <i>Greek</i>, and know something of poetry, my
book begins to be despisâ€™d. Wouâ€™d it not break a Manâ€™s heart to see such

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>INCE the spirit of curiosity possesses us here in this world, no less
than it did in yourâ€™s, â€™tis an infinite trouble for those persons,
Madam, who were acquainted with every thing while they livâ€™d, not to
know all that passes after their death; and of this youâ€™ll one day make
an experiment. I am not desirous to know, Madam, what you have done to
succeed the greatest beauties of the earth, in the affection of an old
libidinous monarch, nor what charms you make use of to secure the
possession of his heart, at an age you cannot please without a miracle.
My planet, dear Madam, has rendered me somewhat knowing in these
affairs, for <i>Henry</i> II. was my gallant as long as he livâ€™d; and thoâ€™ I
was little handsomer than you, I was not, I think, much younger. But I
must tell you, I cannot comprehend what procures you those loud
commendations and applauses which reach even to our ears, and are by
their noise most horribly offensive to us. The advantages of my birth
were great; and it is well known my charms so captivated <i>Francis</i> I.
that they redeemâ€™d my father from the gallows. I marryâ€™d a very
considerable man, and the name of <i>Breze Reneschal</i> of <i>Normandy</i>,
sounds somewhat better than that of <i>Scarron the queenâ€™s ballad-maker</i>.
The house of <i>Poictiers</i> too, from which I was descended, may surely
take place of those monarchs from whom that mercenary fellow <i>Boileau</i>
derives your extraction; and lastly, if I had a few particular enemies,
I did nothing to make myself generally odious. Yet for all this, I was
neither canonizâ€™d nor praisâ€™d, but openly laughâ€™d at, and by one of my
own profession, I mean the duchess of <i>Estampe</i>, who was mistress to the
father of my lover, and said she was born on my wedding-day. Blundering
impudent <i>Bayard</i> was banishâ€™d for speaking too freely of me; and thoâ€™
it was said, <i>That for me alone beauty had the privilege not to grow
old</i>, the compliment was so forcâ€™d, that I was little the better for it.
Ragged <i>Marot</i> was the only poet that ever pretended to couple rhimes in

<p>What think you, Madam, of this, is it not rather satire than praise?
Shouâ€™d the bard, that sings your virtues from the top of <i>Parnassus</i>
down to the market-place, be as sincere, how wouâ€™d you reward him? Thoâ€™
I know he has more prudence, yet I cannot believe he compares you to
<i>Helen</i> for beauty, to <i>Hebe</i> for youth, for chastity to <i>Lucretia</i>, for
courage to <i>Clelia</i>, and for wisdom to <i>Minerva</i>, as common report says;
because, were it true, it is not to be supposâ€™d you would have but a
poor deformâ€™d poet in possession of such mighty treasures. For were
there not scepters and crowns then enticing? Were not then the eyes of
princes open? Did you chuse an author for your love, out of caprice or
despair? Did you take his wicker-chair for a throne? Or did the love of
philosophy draw you in? Had the latter wrought upon you, you would not
have been the first, I must confess; for the famous <i>Hirparchia</i>,
handsome, young, and rich, preferrâ€™d poor crooked <i>Crates</i> before the
wealthiest and most beautiful gentleman of <i>Greece</i>. I am unwilling to
judge uncharitably, but I cannot be perswaded that such an alliance
could be contracted without some pressing necessity. When I reflect on
the beginning, increase, and circumstances of your fortune, I am
astonishâ€™d? for neither your hair, which was grey when you began to
grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_76">{76}</a></span> in favour; nor the remembrance of <a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a vestal once adorned; nor
the idea of a <a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> blooming beauty, whom cruel death suddenly snatchâ€™d
away by the help of a little poison; nor the presence of a <a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> rival,
by so much the more dangerous, because she had triumphâ€™d over several
others, could prove any obstacles to your prosperity. The beautiful lady
that brought you out of your mean obscurity; and in whose service you
thought yourself happy, is now content if you let her enjoy the least
shew of her former greatness. In this Chaos I lose myself, Madam; but if
you will bring me out of my confusion, I faithfully promise to give you
an exact account of all that concerns me, when I shall have the pleasure
of embracing you. I exceedingly commend your prudent conduct; for those
young plants you cultivate in a <a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> terrestial paradice, will one day
produce flowers to crown you; and the zeal you profess for a religion
which began to act furiously in my time, must stop the mouths of the
nicest bigots, and make the tribunal of confession favourable to you;
thoâ€™ perhaps, dear Madam, it may make that of <i>Minos</i> a little more
severe.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">C</span>Uriosity, Madam, being the character of the great and busy, I will
answer you according to your merit and birth, thoâ€™ you have not treated
me so, since you know what charms a lover when youth is gone; I will
dismiss that point to come to the history of my life, and the virtuous
actions I am praisâ€™d for. I know you are of an antient family, that you
marryâ€™d a man of power and riches; and that you were <i>Francis</i> the
Firstâ€™s bedfellow, before his son fell in love with you. As for me, I
was born in the <a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> new world, under a favourable constellation; and
the offspring of a Jaylorâ€™s daughter, with whom my father, thoâ€™ of royal
blood, was obligâ€™d, ei<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_77">{77}</a></span>ther throâ€™ love, or rather necessity, to cohabit.
Fortune, which never yet forsook me, first deprived me of my beggarly
relations, without leaving me wherewithal to cover my nakedness, and
then brought me into <i>Europe</i>, where I found a great many lovers, and
few husbands. Poor deformâ€™d <i>Scarron</i> at last offerâ€™d me his hand; I had
my reasons for accepting him, and his infirmities did not hinder me from
receiving that title which was convenient for one in my circumstances.
In short, I lost him without much concern; and livâ€™d so prudently during
my widowhood, that Madam <i>Montespan</i> took me out of my cell, to bring me
into the intrigues of the court. Every one knows I drove my generous
patroness from the royal bed; and that since my being in favour, I have
been profusely liberal to all my idolaters. Our poets, who do not
resemble <i>Marot</i>, value not honour, provided they have good pensions,
which I generously bestow on them, and they repay me in panegyricks; by
which means I am handsome, young, chaste, virtuous, wise, and of as
noble blood as <i>Alexander</i> the Great. Thoâ€™ I was a Protestant, the
church is not so foolish as to enquire into my religion, thus out of a
principle of gratitude, and to fix her in my interest, I have fillâ€™d the
heart of our monarch with the godly zeal of persecution. I have also
founded a stately <a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> edifice, where I breed up a great many pretty
young virgins, who, no doubt onâ€™t, will prove as modest and discreet as
their founder; and I play so well the part of a queen, that the world
thinks me so in reality. These few hints may give you some light into my
history, Madam, therefore to reward my sincerity, if you find <i>Minos</i>
disposâ€™d to use me severely, prepare him, I beseech you, to be more
favourable.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">L</span>ET all those that are ambitious of the title of favourite learn by the
history of my life, how dan<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">{78}</a></span>gerous a folly it is to monopolize their
princeâ€™s smiles. A man climbs to the top of this slippery ascent throâ€™ a
thousand difficulties; and if he is not moderate in his prosperity,
(which few are) he often falls with a more precipitated shame into
disgrace. I acquirâ€™d, or rather usurpâ€™d, the favour of <i>Edward</i> II. in
whose breast the proud <i>Gaveston</i> had before me licentiously revellâ€™d.
To effect this, my father lent me his helping hand; but without growing
wiser by the examples of others, the vanity of my ambition made me
follow that wandring star, callâ€™d fortune. I no sooner had possessâ€™d
myself of the kingâ€™s ear, but I crept into the secrets of his heart, and
infected it with the blackest venom of mine; acting the part of a
self-interested, not an honest minister. As I valued not the glory of
his reign, or ease of his people, provided I governed him, and renderâ€™d
myself master of his treasures; so did I never move him to relieve the
miserable, or reward the faithful and deserving, but endeavourâ€™d to
blacken the merit of their greatest actions, and so settled the first
motions of his liberality, with reasons of sordid interest. If any
places of trust were to be fillâ€™d, covering my treachery still with the
veil of zeal and love for my country, I recommended only such as were
devoted to my service; pretending ill management in every thing that
went not throâ€™ my hands; and that the nation was betrayâ€™d, whilst I,
like some of you now, was selling it, and was in reality the worst enemy
it had. After I had sacrificâ€™d the great duke of <i>Lancaster</i> to my
revenue, and a hundred persons of quality besides, I sowâ€™d discord in
the royal family, The queen, with the prince of <i>Wales</i> her son, and the
earl of <i>Kent</i>, the kingâ€™s brother, retirâ€™d into <i>France</i>; during which
time I governâ€™d at my ease, wallowâ€™d in luxury and riches, and had
interest enough to hinder <i>Charles</i> the Fair from protecting his sister.
The Pope, who was of my religion, stormâ€™d like a true father, son of the
church, and so frighted the king of <i>France</i>, that in spite of their
nearness of blood, he hunted the queen of <i>England</i> out of his
dominions. But at last the king being reconciled, the queen returns; I
was taken prisoner, and by the laws of the kingdom, sentencâ€™d to be
drawn on a sledge, at sound of trumpet, throâ€™ the streets of <i>Hereford</i>.
The circumstances of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_79">{79}</a></span> death were infamous; my head was exposâ€™d at
<i>London</i>, my bowels, heart, and some others parts of body burnâ€™d, my
carcass abandonâ€™d to the crows, in four parts of the kingdom; the
justest reward a villain, who had almost destroyâ€™d both king and country
couâ€™d expect. This is, gentlemen, favourites and ministers, a picture
you ought all to have in your closets, to keep you from resembling it.
When in favour, banish not justice, clemency and generosity, from the
thrones of your master; and to avoid a just hatred, and make men of
virtue your friends, study the publick interest. Turn over old histories
and youâ€™ll find there is scarce one, or few of us, got peaceably to the
grave, but either starvâ€™d or rotted, or immortalizâ€™d a gibbet. Not one
eye ever wept for our sufferings, pity itself rejoiced. Thus detested on
earth, and cursâ€™d by heaven, our last refuge is to become the prey of
devils. Consider well, gentlemen, and arm yourselves against all those
vicious passions, which will certainly undo you, if you listen to them
as I did. Therefore in the slippery paths of a court, take prudence and
justice for your supports.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE picture you have drawn of your life and death, shews you were
notoriously wicked, and rewarded according to your deserts. But let me
tell you, Sir, that â€™tis a great mistake to believe a minister cannot
manage or steer his prince, without abusing him and the publick. Because
you were the horror of your age, is it an inevitable destiny for other
favourites to be so too? I will not here make my own panegyrick, but
leave that care to posterity: However, I will boldly maintain, that to
suffer a master to divide his benevolence, when one can secure it all to
ones self, is folly and stupidity. A prudent man knows how to make a
right use of his masterâ€™s weakness; and if he finds him inclinâ€™d now and
then to gratify eminent services, he will not seem much averse to it,
provided still he loses nothing by the bargain: But if his prince is of
a covetous temper, charity, which always be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_80">{80}</a></span>gins at home, then bids him
shut up his <i>Exchequer</i>, and reserve to himself the sole privilege of
opening it at leisure. â€™Tis likewise no ill step in our politicks to cry
down those actions, which might otherwise by their weight out-value
ours: Upon such occasions to testify the least zeal, fidelity and care,
will be thought meritorious. Thoâ€™ the escutcheons we leave our children,
have some blots in them, what signifies that, provided we leave them
rich and noble titles, which will procure them honour, and all sorts of
pleasures in this world, and a saintâ€™s place hereafter, in that
uncertain volume of the <i>Roman Almanack</i>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>S you may wonder, madam, that I who lived so many ages ago, and at
present am so many thousand leagues from you, should esteem and love
you; might I wonder too, in my turn, if you should have a good opinion
of me, after so many historians have conspired to blacken my reputation.
But there are, dear sister, such circumstances in our fortunes, as ought
to make us love one another, and hold a friendly correspondence; since
you are like me, the daughter of a beautiful, treacherous prince, who
drags good fortune at his heels; and of a mother who renounced the world
before it did her the injury of renouncing her. I was once the ornament
of the court of <i>Augustus</i>, and you now shine like a star, in that of
<i>Lewis</i> XIV. I was marryâ€™d very young to <i>Marcellus</i>, the hopes of the
<i>Romans</i>; and almost in your infancy, you were given to the most amiable
man that ever was of the <i>Bourbons</i>: I lost the son of <i>Octavia</i> some
months after our marriage, and your forehead was bound with the fatal
sable, before <i>Hymen</i>â€™s garlands were in the least withered; you are
handsome, I was not ugly; you occasion jealousy, and I sufferâ€™d the
sharpest darts of destruction: I had lovers beyond number; and who is
able to reckon yourâ€™s? They have not perhaps been so favourably
received; and I believe the air, and want of opportunity, not our
inclinations, to be the cause, for you never yet despisâ€™d those
pleasures I daily enjoyâ€™d and sighâ€™d after; and thoâ€™ by the death of
<i>Agrippa</i>, I came under the tyranny of <i>Tiberius</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_81">{81}</a></span> I pursuâ€™d my
inclinations to the last. Widows of your age generally enter the list
again: But, princess, the counsel I have to give you, is, to reserve to
yourself the liberty of your choice. There are so many <i>Tiberius</i>â€™s
where you are, that one may easily fall to your share, and after that
nothing but banishment will be wanting to finish the comparison. A very
malignant <a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> planet at present commands your destiny; and â€™tis in vain
to expect justice from that jealous, ill-naturâ€™d fury. Now I have given
you advice, which, if I could return into the world, I would follow
myself, permit me to justify my actions.</p>

cost me, without any regard to the ownerâ€™s birth and condition: But do
you think that so very criminal? Does a little kindness deserve so
severe a censure? Must persons of quality be always obligâ€™d to have an
eye on their dignity? and did not he that made the prince, make the
coachman? But what I cannot with patience suffer, is the impudent lie
some have made concerning <i>Ovid</i>; that versifyer had a nicer fancy in
poetry than beauty; like your father, <i>My dear sister</i>, he imaginâ€™d
wonderful charms in grey hairs; for <i>Marcellus</i> was but newly dead when
he fell in love with <i>Livia</i>. â€™Twas her he celebrated under the feigned
name of <i>Corinna</i>; and when he pleasâ€™d, disciplinâ€™d, she, like a child
not daring to resist. Thus people being ignorant of closer privacies,
invent malicious lies; for do you suppose I would have sufferâ€™d such
insolent usage? And that if I had not been strong enough to have cuffâ€™d
that rhiming puppy, I would not have found out some other way to have
been even with him? You very well see my reasons have some appearance of
truth, and I am confident, that when we meet we shall agree very well.
The emperor who had his private amours, never troubled those of his
wife; and <i>Merena</i>â€™s spouse, proud of possessing the affections of so
great a monarch, returned in soft embraces the favours bestowed on her
husband. I have insensibly made you an ingenuous consession; do you the
same, madam, for hell is so damnable tiresome, that I gape and stretch a
thousand times an hour. When your hand is in, pray send me word<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">{82}</a></span> what
they are doing in your part of the world; but above all, give me a true
account of your amours and conquests; for those relations tickle us,
even when we have lost the power of acting. Therefore to invite you to
be very plain with me, as likewise to divert myself in my present
melancholy moments, I will give you some of my thoughts in metre, such
as it is.</p>

<p>As reproaching and talking freely is not here discouraged; so had I done
any lewd trick, your confessor wouâ€™d have acquainted you with it; for he
keeps a strict correspondence with the chiefest ministers of our

of your curiosity, will never forgive you. The mealy mouthâ€™d Goddess was

not believe the character I give of myself, consult <a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Calprinede</i>,
who has drawn me to the life, and was a great master in that way, as
<i>Apelles</i> in his. Farewel, fair princess, and remember that <i>Julia</i>
languishes with desire to see you.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Princess_of_Contis_Answer_to_Julia"></a><i>The Princess of</i> <span class="smcap">Conti</span><i>â€™s Answer to</i> <span class="smcap">Julia</span>.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Did not expect to be honoured with a letter from so famous a princess
as <i>Julia</i>: This makes my joy so much the greater. I do sincerely
declare, that I take all you say to me so reasonable, that I can do no
less than applaud it: And I further assure you, that I never searchâ€™d
for your character in those disobliging authors who magnify the lest
false step, and make an elephant of a mouse. I am satisfyâ€™d to know you,
as I find you in <i>Calprinede</i>; and the complaisance he pretends you had
for <i>Ovid</i>, does not hinder me from having a great affection for your
amiable qualities; and believing as advantageously of your modesty as
you can desire. I am not so severe as to imagine a little indulgence can
be a greater crime; but think those who will, for a little natural
civility, ruin the reputation of courteous ladies, to be malicious
people, only envying those gallantries which are addressed to others.
But, madam, you have strangely surprized me with what you tell me of
<i>Livia</i>; for I always believed, that when old ambition was her only
blind side; but am astonished to hear she was amorous. This discovery
confirms the received opinion, that old age has a wanton inclination, as
well as youth, thoâ€™ not so much ability; and since the wife of <i>CÃ¦sar</i>
lovâ€™d the language of the muses, I am not astonished that our saints of
St. <i>Cyril</i> have been charmâ€™d with it. But, dear madam, is it certain
that <i>Ovid</i> disciplinâ€™d her like a child; I thought the <i>Roman</i> ladies
had not wanted that exercise; and I believe my gallants will never be
obliged to come to that extremity with me. I need<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_84">{84}</a></span> not use much
precaution against the folly of a second marriage; for thoâ€™ I was
coupled to a very charming young man, yet I soon found my expectations
bilkâ€™d, because the name of husband and wife, and thoughts of duty so
lessened the pleasures of our softest embraces, that it made them
odious. So that now I only love a spouse for a night, from whom I may be
divorced the next morning; and this perhaps, youâ€™ll find more plainly
expressed in the following lines, as I doubt not, dearest sister, but
you have made the experiment.</p>

<p>And will be always so, illustrious princess, to our great comfort and
satisfaction. You have heard, I suppose, what the writing of a few
letters has cost me; so that I have laid aside all commerce of that
nature at present, and am often obligâ€™d to trifle my thoughts. Had I not
fearâ€™d <i>Mercury</i>â€™s being searched, I would have opened my heart a little
more to you; but if the times ever change, or madam <i>Maintenon</i>, the
governess of <i>Versailles</i>, becomes less inquisitive, you may certainly
expect to receive an epistle, or rather a volume from me.</p>

<p>I put no confidence in the king my father, and he is so jealous of me,
that should he pack up his awls for the other world, I wouâ€™d not trust

That you may yawn and stretch less, and laugh a little more, entertain
yourself with <i>la Fontain</i>â€™s tales, or the school of <i>Venus</i>, both
excellent books in their kind, which I am confident will extreamly
divert you; not so much upon the account of their novelty, as by
recalling to your mind some past actions of your life.</p>

<p>For my part, I highly esteem them both, and youâ€™ll oblige by telling the
author so.</p>

<i>the Younger, to the Flatterers of what Degree or Country
soever</i>.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HOâ€™ the torments I now suffer for my former tyrannies, are as great as
they are just; yet you cursed villains, deserve much greater, for being
the promoters of them. You, with your infernal praises, blind the eyes
of princes, and hurry them on headlong to their ruin: therefore I charge
you with all the ill actions of my reign. I was no sooner seated on my
throne, but you so swellâ€™d me with pride, by applauding all my
perjuries, oppressions and cruelties, that I believâ€™d it lawful for our
race to be tyrants, from father to son, with impunity. Every one knows
my father was equally wicked and covetous, neither sparing, or fearing
men or Gods; and of this <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Ã†sculapius</i> are examples. In a
fit of impiety, till then unpractised by the most desperate villains, he
strippâ€™d the first of his golden mantle, excusing it with this jest,
<i>That â€™twas too hot for the summer, and too cold for the Winter</i>. To the
second he turnâ€™d barber and cut off his golden beard, which with great
devotion had been presented to him, alledging, <i>It was improper for the
son, since his father</i> Apollo <i>went without one</i>. When his conduct had
thus renderâ€™d him odious to the world he thought it necessary to make
himself secure; for which end, he ordered a large deep ditch to be dug
about his palace; but that was no fortification against fear, which
could creep in at every key-hole; and his distrust increased to that
degree, that he suspected his nearest relations. Not so much as a
<i>Maintenon</i> came near him. At last his guards to oblige the world, cut
his throat, and sent his soul as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_86">{86}</a></span> a harbinger to the Devil, to provide
room for his body; and the people thinking me to be a much honester man,
without difficulty placâ€™d me on his throne. But I soon took care to
convince these credulous sots, that a worse was come in his room, far
exceeding him in cruelty, I endeavoured to secure my throne by actions
then unknown to the world. <i>First</i>, I caused my brothers to be put to
death, and when I had glutted myself with the blood of these victims, I
made no scruple to violate the laws, and trample upon all the just
rights and liberties of my people. By those and a thousand other
barbarities, tiring the patience of the <i>Syracusans</i>, they drove me into
<i>Italy</i>, where the <i>Locrians</i> kindly received me: and I to requite them
for their civility, ravishâ€™d their women, murderâ€™d numbers of their
citizens, and pillagâ€™d their country. At last, by a now contrived
treachery, I re-entered <i>Syracuse</i>, with design to revenge myself by new
desolations; but <i>Dion</i> and <i>Timolion</i>, much honester men than either
myself or you, prevented me by putting me a second time to flight. â€™Twas
my destiny, and I wonder historians do not add the epithet of coward, to
my just name of tyrant. I then retired to <i>Corinth</i>, where in a short
time my misery became so pressing, that I was forcâ€™d to turn bum-brusher
in my own defence, a condition which best suited with a man that
delighted in tyranny and blood; and as I had been one of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s
disciples, I taught a sort of philosophy which I had learned, but never
practised. Thus was my throne turnâ€™d into a desk; and my scepter into a
ferula. Heavens! what a shameful metamorphosis was this. But, gentlemen
sycophants, with a murrian to you, I may thank you for it. You, like the
<i>Cameleon</i>, can put on any colour, can turn vice into virtue, and virtue
into vice, to deceive your masters; and under the specious pretence of
religion can commit the greatest barbarities. But thoâ€™ under the shelter
of that reverend name, you think all your iniquities undiscovered, so
you possess your prince with the abominable zeal of persecution; yet
heaven sees and detests your hypocrisy, and even men at long-run,
discover the cheat. Oh! ye unworthy enemies of virtue, whose only aim is
to raise your own fortunes upon the ruin of others. How useful are you
to the Devil? You matter it not, provided you compass your de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_87">{87}</a></span>sired
ends; if we lay waste the universe, and afterwards become the hate and
scorn of all mankind: As for example, â€™tis long of you that I have been
a pedant in <i>Greece</i>, and that <a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> one of my rank, had he not been
taken to rest, would have been forced to cover his follies under a
stinking cowl, in the lousy convent of <i>la Trape</i>. You will not fail, I
know, to applaud all his actions, and say, if he lost all, â€™twas only
for obliging his subjects to take the true road to heaven, and give the
title of resignation to meer necessity and compulsion. But is it a
sacrifice to renounce throâ€™ despair, the grandeur we cannot maintain any
longer? Is it not rather imitating the <i>animal in the fable</i>, that
despises the grapes which are out of his reach? But I waste my lungs in
vain, and talk to the deaf: however, if I have been humbled, believe
that you will not always be exalted. â€™Tis my comfort that you will one
day be condemned to turn a wheel like <i>Ixion</i>, to roll stones like
<i>Sysiphus</i>, to be devoured like <i>Prometheus</i>, continually thirsty like
<i>Tantalus</i>, and to heighten your evils, that you will never lose the
remembrance of those villanies you committed.</p>

treaties, wouâ€™d not they govern in peace and unity? And wouâ€™d not that

be melancholy living in it, and starve millions of all degrees and
professions, who now, lord it very handsomely? We, Iâ€™m sure, shouâ€™d be
first sensible of it, by having no variety of news to stuff our <i>London
Gazettes</i>, <i>Mercuries</i> and <i>Slips</i> with; which wouâ€™d make the
booksellers withdraw our stipends, and by consequence oblige us to leave
off tipping the generous juice of the grape, and content ourselves with

harangues for your school-boys, and do not maliciously take our daily
bread from us, and seek to ruin those complaisant persons, that can
condescend to sooth the vanities and inclinations of their princes. But
to dismiss this point, and return to yourself; â€™tis plain you have not a
jot of honour about you, since you pay no regard to your fatherâ€™s
reputation. We easily perceive you have been a <i>pedagogue</i> by your
tattling; which indiscretion makes you unworthy the title of great
<i>Pluto</i>â€™s disciple. But has your pedantick majesty no better rewards to
bestow on gentlemen of courtly breeding than wheels, vultures,
millstones, and an eternal thirst? Truly â€™tis very liberal, and
school-master like in every respect; but you are desired to keep those
mighty blessings for yourself, who deserve them much better than any one
else; and if you were cullied by those about you, talk no more onâ€™t, but
keep your weakness to yourself.</p>

<h2><a id="Christiana_Queen_of_Sweden_to_the_Ladies"></a><span class="smcap">Christiana</span>, <i>Queen of</i> <span class="smcap">Sweden</span>, <i>to the Ladies</i>.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HAT I, who never testifyâ€™d much esteem for the fair sex, should at this
time address myself to them, will without doubt be thought strange; but
if necessity breaks laws, it ought also to cancel aversion, and excuse
me for seeking protection amongst a sex I have so often despised, being
compelled to it by a thousand injuries done to my memory. Therefore I
now ask pardon of the ladies; and am perswaded I do them no little
honour, (since there has seldom been a more extraordinary woman than I
was) in owning myself one of the female kind. <i>First</i>, I may boast of
all the advantage of a glorious birth, being daughter of the <i>Great
Gustavus Adolphus</i>, who did not only fill the north, but all the
universe with admiration; and of <i>Mary Elianor</i> of <i>Brandenburgh</i>, the
worthy wife of such a husband. If I was not as handsome as <i>Helen</i>, and
those other beauties, whom the poets have from age to age recorded in
the book of fame, yet all the world ownâ€™d me a woman of incomparable
parts. I was queen at five years of age, and even so early took upon me
that important trust, which but few men are capable to dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_89">{89}</a></span>charge, and
which fewer would covet, if they knew the troubles that attend it; yet I
supported the weight of all affairs with such a grace and prudence, that
my crown did not seem too heavy for me. As soon as reason had made me
sensible of my power, my only thoughts were how to make myself worthy of
it. To this end, I invited to my court those I thought the most capable
of improving it; which was no sooner known by the beggary <i>French</i>, but
<i>Stockholm</i> swarmâ€™d with masters of all sciences. Among the rest I had a
pack of hungry poets; but he that took the most pains, was not the best
rewarded, because he did not resemble <i>Boileau</i>, who can in half an hour
make a saint of a devil. In my green years, I seemâ€™d only addicted to
grandeur and virtue; for I studied like a doctor, argued like a
philosopher, and gave lessons of morality to the most learned; so that
every body imaginâ€™d I should eclipse the most famous <i>heroines</i>. But I
had not yet heard the voice of a certain deity, whose language I no
sooner understood, but it poisonâ€™d all my former good dispositions; for
whereas till then I had been charmâ€™d with the conversation of the dead,
I began now to have passionate inclinations for the living. But not to
undeceive the world, which thought my conduct blameless, I was forcâ€™d to
put a curb to my desires, or at least to pursue them with more
precaution, whether the trouble to find myself so inclinâ€™d, or my
grandeur, which wouâ€™d not allow of those liberties I sighâ€™d for, obligâ€™d
me to punish the flatterers of my passion, I know not; but I committed
many barbarities. As my desires were insatiable, so â€™twas not in my
power to confine them; and this gave my subjects too many opportunities
to discover several indecencies in my management; and because I wouâ€™d
not be tumbled headlong from my throne by them, I very prudently
condescended, and put my cousin <i>Charles Adolphus</i> in my place. Then did
I, under pretence of visiting the beauties of <i>France</i>, take large doses
of those joys I durst no longer take at <i>Stockholm</i>. I was treated every
where as a queen, had palaces at my command, and I made at
<i>Fountainbleau</i>, which was before a bawdy-house, a slaughter-house also
before I left it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span></p>

<p>But I know not whether the monarch of <i>France</i> had long ears like his
brother <i>Midas</i>, or some little familiar whisperâ€™d it in his ear; but
what I thought could never be detected, was publickly discoursed at
court. Perceiving this, I resolved on a voyage to <i>Rome</i>, and the
rather, because I thought the <i>Romish</i> religion most commodious for a
woman of inclinations, and that it would illustrate my history, to
abjure the opinion of <i>Luther</i> at the feet of the pope; thoâ€™ I had as
little believed and followed the doctrine of the <i>Reformed</i>, as I have
since the absurdities of the <i>Roman</i> church. <i>Italy</i> seemâ€™d to me a
paradice, and I thought my past troubles fully recompensed, when I found
myself in that famous city, which has been the mistress of this world,
without subjects to controul me; saucy chattering <i>Frenchmen</i> to revile
me, and amongst a mixture of strangers, which made all my actions pass
unregarded. â€™Twas enough for me to be esteemed a saint, that I was
turnâ€™d Papist in a place where debauchery is tolerated; and youâ€™ll find
me, perhaps, one day canonized by the <i>Roman</i> clergy. â€™Tis true, I was
not so rigorous to them as others for the pope, cardinals, legates,
bishops, abbots, priests, and monks, composed my court, where
licentiousness reignâ€™d most agreeably. Not that I had renounced the
company<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_91">{91}</a></span> of young virgins; for I was intimate enough with some of them,
to have it said, I was of the humour of <i>Sappho</i>; and as I livâ€™d at
<i>Rome</i>, so I thought myself obliged to practise their manners. But the
chief reason of my writing, is to desire you to protect me against those
ignorant coxcombs, who endeavour to put me among the number of the
foolish virgins; for I began and finished my course, as I have told you,
and will now leave you, to judge if there can be any probability in such
a scandalous story. My good friend the pope, to whom I had been
wonderfully civil, solemnly swore, that whenever I left this world, I
mould not languish in Purgatory, thoâ€™ he knew very well I should go to
another place. But as it was the promise of a tricking <i>Jesuit</i>, so I
did not much credit it, nor was much surprizâ€™d to see myself turnâ€™d into
a sty, among a company of boars and old lascivious goats, a sort of
animals I had formerly been well acquainted with at my palace in <i>Rome</i>,
and who came then grunting and leaping to embrace me. I cannot in this
place hear of the poor gentleman whom I murthered; I asked one of my
he-companions concerning him, who knows no more of him than I do;
therefore I verily believe he is among the martyrs.</p>

<p>But â€™tis easy to judge your conscience is as large as the sleeve of a
<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> <i>Cordelier</i>, since you began in the spirit, and ended in the flesh.
Notwithstanding what I have merrily ownâ€™d in rhime, more to entertain
your majesty, than express my true sentiments, there are certain hours
when I could willingly follow your example; and if you would obtain from
the holy father a dispensation of my vows, which now grow burthensome to
me, I would break a lance in your quarrel: this I am sure of, that the
world will think it less strange to see a nun renounce her convent, than
a queen her crown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<h2><a id="Francis_Rablais_to_the_Physicians_of_Paris"></a><span class="smcap">Francis Rablais</span>, <i>to the</i> Physicians <i>of</i> Paris.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is in vain for your flatterers to cry you up for able doctors, for
you will never arrive at my knowledge; and I am ashamâ€™d every hour to
hear such asses are admitted into the college. Do not believe â€™tis a
sensible vanity that induces me to say this, but the perfect knowledge I
have of my own worth; and thoâ€™ I was designâ€™d for a more lazy
profession, yet that does not in the least diminish my merit. You know I
was born at <i>Chinon</i>, and that my parents, hoping I should one day make
a precious saint, put me, in my foolish infancy, into a convent of
<i>Cordeliers</i>: but that greasy habit, in a little time, seemâ€™d to me as
heavy and uneasy as the armour of a giant; so that by intercession made
to Pope <i>Clement</i> VII. I was permitted to change my grey frock for a
black; so I quitted the equipage of St. <i>Francis</i> for that of St.
<i>Benedict</i>, and that I was as weary of in a short time as of the other.
As I had learnt a great deal of craft, and but little religion, during
my noviciate in those good schools, so I found a way to get loose from
that cloyster for ever, and took to the study of <i>Hippocrates</i>. Besides
that I had a subtle and clear genius; my comrades discoverâ€™d in me an
acute natural raillery, which made me acceptable to the best companions,
Cardinal <i>Bellay</i>, who made me his physician, took me to <i>Rome</i> with him
in that quality, where the sanctity of the triple crown, the adorâ€™d
slipper, and all-opening key, could not hinder me from jesting in the
presence of his holiness. â€™Twas <i>Paul</i> III. before called <i>Alexander
Fernese</i>, who then fillâ€™d the apostolical chair, and was more remarkable
for his lewdness than piety. I had the good fortune to please him with
the inclination he found in me to lewdness; and he gave me a bull of
absolution for my apostacy, free from all fee and duties, which I think
was a gracious reward for a foreign, atheistical buffoon. After I had
compilâ€™d a catalogue of his vices, to make use of as I should find an
opportunity, the cardinal, my patron, returnâ€™d to <i>Paris</i>, and I with
him, where he immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">{94}</a></span> gratifyâ€™d me with a canonship of St. <i>Maur</i>,
and the benefice of <i>Meudon</i>. Hiving all I could desire, I livâ€™d
luxuriously; and the love of satire pleasing me much more than the
service of God, after I had wrote several things without success, for
the learned, I composed the history of <i>Gargantua</i> and <i>Pantagruel</i>; for
the ignorant, things which some call a cock and a bull, and others the
product of a lively imagination. I know most men understand them as
little as they do <i>Arabick</i>; and as it is not to our present purpose, so
do not I intend to explain that stuff to them, but will now, since â€™tis
more <i>a propos</i>, give you some advice concerning the malady of your
blustering monarch. The residence I made at the court of <i>France</i>, in
the reign of <i>Francis</i> I. makes me more bold in judging of the nature of
those distempers. You conceal the virulency of <i>Lewis</i> XIVthâ€™s disease,
because you dare not examine into the bottom of the cause, and are more
modest in proposing remedies, than he has been in contracting the
distemper. Yet every one talks according to his interest, and the
news-mongers always keep a blank to set down the manner of his death. If
he does not tremble, he must be thorow-pacâ€™d in iniquity, for he has
several reckonings to make up with Heaven, which are not so easily
adjusted; and as he has often affronted the majesty of several popes, he
will scarce obtain a pass-port to go scot-free into the other world. We
are told here, by some of his good friends, he begins to putrify, and
has ulcers a yard in length, where vermin, very soldier like, intrench
themselves. There is no other remedy for this, according to old
<i>Ã†sculapius</i>, but to make him a new man, by a severe penitential
pilgrimage into some of the provinces of <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Turpentine</i>. If
he still fears the danger of war, let him go in disguise; and if at this
age he cannot be without a she-companion, let him take his old friend
<i>Maintenon</i> along with him, she is poison-proof, and may, to save
charges, serve him in three capacities, <i>viz.</i> as a bedfellow, nurse,
and guide; keep him also to a strict diet; scrape his bones, and purge
him thoroughly, and all may be found again but his conscience. You
cannot imagine how merrily we gentlemen of the faculty live at <i>Pluto</i>â€™s
court: I am secretary to the same <i>Paul</i> III. who pardonâ€™d me <i>gratis</i>
the viola<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_95">{95}</a></span>tion of my vows, my irreverence for the church, and my want of
respect for him; <i>Scaramouch</i> is his gentleman-usher, <i>Harlequin</i> his
page, and <i>Scarron</i> his poet laureat. Donâ€™t suppose I was such a
blockhead as to kiss his sweaty toe, when I visited him in the
<i>Vatican</i>; he had nothing from me, but such an hypocritical hug, as your
monks give each other at the ridiculous ceremony of high-mass. This old
goat still keeps his amorous inclinations; and I, who have so often made
others blush, am often ashamâ€™d to hear his ribaldry. He would certainly
make love to <i>Proserpine</i>, but our sultan would not be pleasâ€™d with his
courtship; and besides, his seraglio is as well guarded as the grand
seigniorâ€™s, otherwise we might have a litter of fine puppies betwixt
them. Little hump-shoulderâ€™d <i>Luxembourg</i>, lately mareschal of <i>France</i>,
is the captain of her guards, and so damnably jealous, that he will not
suffer any to come near her; at which <i>Pluto</i> is very well pleasâ€™d, and
does not mistrust him, thinking it impossible for any body to be in love
with such a lump of deformity. But to return to our friend <i>Paul</i>, he
scorns to copy after the Devil, who turnâ€™d hermit when he was old; and I
am now making another collection of his impieties and amours, which will
be ready to come out with a <i>Gazette Nostradamus</i> he has been composing
since the year 1600. That sly conjurer is so earnest upon the matter,
that he lifts not up his head, thoâ€™ <i>Pluto</i>â€™s black-guard boys are
continually burning brimstone under his nose. However, I do not know but
this mountain may bring forth a mouse; for to speak freely, I put as
little faith in those prophets, who, like sots, lose their reason in the
abyss of futurity, as the honest whigs of <i>England</i> do in the oaths and
treaties of your swaggering master. As for you, brother doctor, cut,
scarify, blister, and glyster, since â€™tis your profession; but take this
along with you, that they who do the least mischief, pass with me for
the ablest men. But I would advise you not to suffer any longer those
barbarous names of assassins, poisoners, closestool-mongers, factors of
death, <i>&amp;c.</i> the world gives you. I have had high words with <i>Moliere</i>
on your account, and I expect that fine rhiming fellow, <i>Boileau</i>, will
give him a wipe over the nose in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_96">{96}</a></span> one of his satires. For thoâ€™ I have
made bold to talk freely with you, yet I do not mean all the world
should take the same liberty.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU are a very pretty gentleman, friend <i>Rablais</i>, to boast of yourself
so much, and value the rest of your fraternity so little. Do not you
know that I am of the tribe of <i>Judah</i>, and perhaps related to some of
the kings of <i>Israel</i>? Had you heard me preach in a synagogue, you wouâ€™d
soon be convincâ€™d whether I am an illiterate fellow or no. Is it such an
honour to be of your college? Or wouâ€™d it be any advantage to be like
you? You have been, by your own confession, a most horrid rake-hell; and
I would not, for all the mammon of unrighteousness in my kingâ€™s coffer,
transgress one point of the law. You ought not to be astonished at my
greatness, for I concern myself with more than one trade, and no man was
ever in such favour, and grew so rich, by only applying warm injections
to the backside. If you enjoyâ€™d a prebend, and other benefices, you
must, I know, have assisted cardinal <i>Bellay</i> in his amours. For my
part, I boast of having been a broker, sollicitor, and, under the rose,
<i>Billet-deux</i> carrier and door-keeper, because all employments at court
are honourable, especially in that great concern of <i>S&#8212;&#8212;y</i>. Do not
you think you were the first that thought of the remedy you speak of; we
had several learned consultations about it, but know not which way to
mention it, for Madam <i>Scarron</i>, who is very tender of her reputation,
and reigns sovereignly at court, will say we accuse her of bringing the
<i>Neapolitan</i> distemper to <i>Versailles</i>, and have us sent to the gallies,
or hangâ€™d for our good advice. I have often reflected on the scandalous
bantering stuff of those they call wits, have said, and do say of us;
and wish with all my heart, the first brimstone they take for the itch,
and mercury for the pox, may poison â€™em; but for us to stir inâ€™t, would
bring â€™em all about our ears; and we know the conse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_97">{97}</a></span>quence of that from
a neighbouring <a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> country, where they have mumbled a poor physician
<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, and one that can versify also, almost as severely as a troop of
hungry wolves would a fat ass. However, we thank you for your zeal; but
at the same time advise you not to make a quarrel for so small a
business; and I, in a particular manner, kiss your hand, and desire you
will give my service to <i>Nostradamus</i>. I cannot beat it out of my head,
but that he has put me into his <a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> centuries; and that an ingenious
man might discover me there. I own â€™tis looking for a needle in a bottle
of hay; but you know I sprung up like a mushroom, and that he foretels
nothing but prodigies.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Duchess_of_Fontagne_to_the_Cumean_Sibyl"></a><i>The Duchess of</i> Fontagne <i>to the</i> Cumean Sibyl.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Desirâ€™d <i>Mercury</i> to call, <i>en passant</i>, at your cave; and as he has
wings at his feet, and complaisance in heart, so he will, I donâ€™t doubt,
go a little out of his way to oblige me, by delivering you this letter:
I have from my infancy had you in my mind, and heard my nurse, when I
lay squawling in shitten clouts in my cradle, tell frightful stories of
you. As soon as I began to prattle, my maids taught me to call all old
wrinkled women witherâ€™d sibyls; and the idea of the den you were
confinâ€™d in, fillâ€™d me with fear. But since I have been informâ€™d of the
truth of your history, that fear is changâ€™d into veneration, and I now
look upon your cell as a sacred place. To assure you of my respect and
the confidence I repose in you, I will consult you about some future
events, and tell you one part of my griefs. I am nobly born, handsome
and young enough to inspire and receive the softest love. The <i>French</i>
king, who had spoilâ€™d the shape, and wore out the charms of several
mistresses, long before I appearâ€™d at his court, had a mind to do the
same by me. Being naturally proud and wanton, and tempted by the fine
compliments of a great and vigorous prince, and title of duchess, (a
temptation none of us<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_98">{98}</a></span> women can resist) I soon yielded to his desires;
which so mortifyâ€™d the haughty <i>Montespan</i>, that she, with a ragoo
<i>a-la-mode dâ€™Espagne</i>, dispatchâ€™d me out of the world, before I could
get a true taste of greatness, or the pleasures of a royal bed. Alas!
What a mighty difference there is between you and me; your years are
innumerable; you are still mentioned in history; your voice still
remains, and you enjoy the divine faculty of prediction; but I was
murtherâ€™d in my bloom, when ripe and juicy as the luscious grape; and
that ungrateful perjurâ€™d man, who rifled my virgin treasures, has not so
much as thought or spoke of me since. He dotes on nothing but old age;
and could you appear in something more solid than air, I do not doubt
but heâ€™d make his addresses to you: I believe his being born with teeth
presagâ€™d he would always be a tyrant to his people, and in his latter
days the cully of such a tough piece of carrion as Mrs. <i>Maintenon</i>.
<i>Morbleu!</i> Have I barbarously been sacrificâ€™d; and must a miss of
threescore and fifteen live unpunishâ€™d, and be treated better than I was
in the greatest heighth of that princeâ€™s passion, and warmth of my
desires, when capable both of receiving and giving joy? It really
distracts me! And I conjure you, in the name of <i>Apollo</i>, who never
refusâ€™d you any thing, to let me know by one of your oracles, if I shall
never return to <i>France</i> again. You came hither, I know, with the brave
<i>Ã†neas</i>, (but stayâ€™d no longer than you likâ€™d the place) and I have
heard some people say, that knight-errant diverted himself extremely
upon the road, and made a great deal of hot love to you; but I take that
to be a meer story, because <i>Virgil</i>, who would not have let slip so
pleasant a passage, has said nothing of it. However, could I return but
a short time to dislodge <i>Maintenon</i>, and take a frisk with my former
lover, if he be not too old for that business; or were I but your
shadow, provided I livâ€™d, I should be pretty well pleasâ€™d; for â€™tis a
melancholy thing to think that the fates should spin such a long thread
for an old lascivious ape <a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, who never was to be compared with me;
and that there should remain no more of poor <i>Fontagne</i>, than an
unfortunate name, over<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_99">{99}</a></span> which oblivion will in a little time triumph. At
the writing of this, in came a courier from <i>Versailles</i>, who brings us
word, that <i>Lewis the Great</i> has undertook such a piece of work, that
the weight and consequence makes him sick of the world: that Mrs.
<i>Maintenon</i> has wore out his teeth; that legions of vermin devour him,
and that we may suddenly expect him in these dominions; which, if true,
will be some satisfaction to me; and thoâ€™ he be toothless, worm-eaten
and rotten: I will grant him the same liberty he often took with me on a
couch at the <i>Trianon</i>, to get him again under my empire, that I may at
leisure revenge myself for his forgetfulness.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Cumean_Sybils_Answer_to_the_Duchess_of_Fontagne"></a><i>The</i> Cumean Sybil<i>â€™s Answer to the Duchess of</i> Fontagne.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>S it possible that so charming a beauty should think of such an old
decrepid creature as I am! I was desirous to talk with <i>Mercury</i> about
you, but he flew away like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span> bird. It extremely troubles me, dear
child, that I am obligâ€™d, in answer to your letter, to tell you there is
no hopes of your returning to <i>Versailles</i>; for you must consider that
when I conducted <i>Ã†neas</i>, I was then living, and that â€™tis impossible
for any under a <i>Hercules</i> to fetch you from whence you are; and where
shall we find one now? The bravest <i>Boufflers</i> in <i>France</i> is but a
link-boy in comparison to him. Your lover, <i>fair lady</i>, is so fast
linkâ€™d to his old <a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> <i>Duegna</i>â€™s tail, that he thinks no more of you
and your complaints are insignificant.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> She that hurried you out of
the world in the flower of your youth, with a favourable dose of poison,
is now neglected, and grown so monstrous fat and lecherous, by living
lazily in a nunnery, that sheâ€™s not a fit companion for any creature
that has but two legs to support it. You know not what you do, when you
envy my destiny, for Iâ€™m sometimes so teizâ€™d and tirâ€™d with answering
the <i>virtuosos</i> and <i>beaux</i>, that it turns my very brain. I own, â€™tis a
sad thing to dye at eighteen, in the heighth of oneâ€™s greatness and
pleasures, because nature always thinks she pays her tribute to death
before-hand. I would willingly divert you a little, but I know not which
way, unless this little history I send you, which a traveller gave me
not long since, and which has novelty to recommend itself, will do it.
Do not believe, good lady, the scandalous story some ignorant rhiming
puppy has made of <i>Ã†neas</i> and me; he was not so brisk as that comes to;
and I can assure you, never put the question to me. Ask <i>Dido</i>, she can
tell you more of him than I can; and as modest as <i>Virgil</i> describes
her, yet she was forcâ€™d to take this <i>Trojan</i> prince by the throat to
make him perform the duty of a gallant; by this you may judge of his
constitution: besides, had he been never so amorously inclinâ€™d, yet not
knowing my inclinations, he might think his courtship would displease
me, and so disoblige <i>Apollo</i>, for whose assistance he then had
occasion. Therefore laugh at all those idle railleries of impertinent

<p class="nind"><i>Furetiere.</i> <span class="bigg">O</span>H! Have I found you at last, old friend? Thoâ€™ I were
certain you were here, and desirâ€™d earnestly to see you; yet being
gouty, and tirâ€™d with walking, I began to have no more thoughts of
searching after you. How many troublesome journeys I have made, and
leagues have I travellâ€™d, and all to kiss your hands, thoâ€™ I am a
virtuoso, I cannot tell; for in truth, I am quite out of my element, and
confounded ever since I have lost sight of sun and moon.</p>

<p><i>Scarron.</i> Who are you, and please ye? Whatâ€™s your name? For the dead
having neither beard nor bonnet, nor any thing else to distinguish them
by, I know not exactly what, or who you are; but by your language and
mien, suppose you some mungril of the <i>French</i> academy.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Well guessâ€™d; I am callâ€™d Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ© Furetiere</i>,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
alias <i>Porc de bon Dieu</i>, who has long, but in vain, been gaping and
scraping at <i>Versailles</i> for a mitre, that I might wallow in peace and
plenty like a hog. But alas! what a left-handed planet was I born under?
A debauch with stummed wine, setting an old pox, which lay dormant in my
bones, into a ferment, soon carryâ€™d me off, almost in the heighth of my
desires, and when I bad fairest for the bishoprick.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I am sorry for your misfortune; but am at the same time heartily
glad to see you, Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>. You will not, perhaps, meet with all
these conveniencies here, you enjoyâ€™d at <i>Paris</i>; but, in recompense,
you will meet with much honester dealing. For my part, I must own myself
infinitely happy; for now I am neither troubled with lawyers,
physicians, apothecaries, collectors of taxes, priests, nor wife, the
plague and torment of menâ€™s days when on earth. But how have you had
your health since you have been in the country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">{102}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Thanks to our master <i>Pluto</i>, I have not yet felt any cold. I
was so very tender and chill for six months in the year at <i>Paris</i>, that
thoâ€™ I was loaded with ermins, and always had a dram of the best <i>Nantz</i>
in my pocket, I could scarce keep my blood from freezing in my veins.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Thatâ€™s an affliction you will not meet with here, take my word
forâ€™t; for â€™tis something hotter than under the <i>torrid zone</i>, and the
nicest wits of your academy, need not fear spoiling their brains, by
catching cold here. It is not long since I met with the illustrious
<i>Balzac</i>, who does not complain now of the cold in his head, as he did
when he livâ€™d on the pleasant banks of the <i>Charante</i>. But, what news
have you?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> I donâ€™t doubt, by your inquisitiveness, but you are very
desirous to hear some news of your wife.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> May pox and itch devour the nasty jade! I know but too much of
her by mareschal <i>dâ€™Albert</i> formerly, and lately, by my likeness
Monsieur <i>Luxemburg</i>; yes, I know sheâ€™s a duchess; that sheâ€™s one of the
privy-council; and she serves <i>Lewis</i> the XIV. in the same capacity as
<i>Livia</i> did <i>Augustus</i>. But why did not the prostitute make her poor
deformâ€™d husband a duke? I should not have been the first duke and peer
of <i>France</i>, that had been a cuckold.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> By your discourse, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, one would think you had lost
your senses and memory: But you cannot surely have forgot how, instead
of laurel, she adornâ€™d your learned brow with horns, before she was
taken notice of at court; Indeed how could a pretty, witty, buxom, young
woman, forbear making such an infirm, deformâ€™d <i>Ã†sop</i> as you a cuckold?</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I should not have much valued that, because I had brethren
enough to herd with, if the damnâ€™d whore had but got my pension
augmented; but the confounded jade, instead of that, gave me the
cursedâ€™st garrison to maintain, that ever poor husband was mortifyâ€™d
with: To appease which, I was forcâ€™d to have recourse to <i>Unguentum
contra pediculos inguinales</i>, &amp;c. But prithee letâ€™s discourse of
something else, for the thoughts of the duchess of <i>Maintenon</i>, will
disturb my brain, and easily put me into a fever, which is dangerous in
this warm climate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Iâ€™ll tell you but three or four words more of this famous
duchess, and conclude. <i>First</i>, That she has kickâ€™d her patroness, Madam
<i>Montespan</i> out of the royal bed: And <i>Secondly</i>, That she is very great
with the pious jesuit, father <i>la Chaise</i>, the monarchâ€™s confessor.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh! oh! by my troth, I donâ€™t wonder at the lascivious harlot,
for closing with him! as there is no feast like the misers, so there is
no gallantry like those monks. When those hypocrites undertake that
business, they do it all like heroes. But you have said all, by saying
he is a jesuit, since those gallants have been in reputation, they have
engrossed all good whoring to their society, especially in <i>France</i>, and
more particularly at <i>Paris</i>, where they have so well behavâ€™d
themselves, that they have changâ€™d an antient authentick proverb,
<i>Jacobine en <a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> chair, Cordelier en <a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> chÅ“ur, Carme en <a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> cusine,
&amp; Augustine en <a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> bordel</i>, for now they say, <i>Jesuit en bordel, &amp;c.</i>
But so much for those gentlemen, pray what are you a doing now in the
<i>French</i> academy?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> There are as many follies committed there, as in any society in
the universe; judge of the whole by this one example. That company was
never so highly honourâ€™d as it is at present, by the particular care
that great monarch takes of it; for which he is repaid in flattering
panegyricks. Nevertheless, these insipid, florid, gentlemen, scold and
scratch like so many fish-women in an alehouse. The other day the great
<i>Charpentier</i> fell into such a passion about a trifle, that he
reproachâ€™d the learned <i>Taleman</i>, of being the son of a broken
apothecary at <i>Rochel</i>; to which <i>Taleman</i> with as much heat replyâ€™d,
<i>Charpentier</i> was the son of poor hedge ale-draper at <i>Paris</i>. From this
<i>Billingsgate</i> language they came to blows. <i>Charpentier</i> threw
<i>Nicot</i>â€™s dictionary at his adversaryâ€™s head, and <i>Taleman</i> threw
<i>Morery</i>â€™s at <i>Charpentier</i>â€™s. We all wishâ€™d heartily we could have
recallâ€™d you from the dead, to write the various accidents of this
battle, in your comical and satyric style.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Ha, ha, ha, had I been there, they should have beat the academy
dictionary and <i>Morery</i>â€™s too in pieces about each otherâ€™s ears, before
I would have parted them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_104">{104}</a></span> But I hope these two sputtering coxcombs did
each other justice; I declare, whoever hinderâ€™d it, deservâ€™d to be
severely fined. Pray how did you behave yourself during this combat?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> I happenâ€™d not to be there; for you must know, there has been
such a difference between those gentlemen and me, concerning a
dictionary I have publishâ€™d, that it came at last to a contentious
law-suit; but what was laid on either side, only made the world laugh at
both, and is not half so diverting as the epigram you made upon an, old
lady that went to law with you: I think I still remember it.&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> May that be the fate of <i>Taleman</i>, <i>Charpentier</i>, and the rest
of those reformers of the alphabet, and in a more especial manner of
that thieving flattering rogue <a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> <i>Despaux</i>, who has made a faithless
poltron, a <i>Mars</i>, and a super-annuated lascivious adultress, a saint.
So much for that &#8212;&#8212; But give me some little account now of your clergy,
I mean the great plump rogues, the hogs with mitres on their heads, and
crosiers on their shoulders, those janizaries of antichrist.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> I know your meaning&#8212;&#8212; Never was nickname given with more
justice to any society of men. In <i>Normandy</i>, and those parts they call
all the minor clergy, as the fat monks, canons, abbots, <i>&amp;c.</i> who are
not mitred, <i>Jesus Christ</i>â€™s porkers; which distinction is not very
fan<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_105">{105}</a></span>tastical, if we allow the other expression. But no more of those
gentlemen, â€™tis dangerous.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Prithee, dear abbot, be not so mealy-mouthâ€™d; when I was in the
world, the greatest pleasure I had, was in attacking those gentlemanâ€™s
vices, and exposing them to the hereticks, that still-born generation of
vipers, as they call them, and therefore let us be free now; â€™tis the
only enjoyment we can have. Pray what says your <i>Monthly Mercury</i> of
those gentleman, whom the earth is more obligâ€™d to for bodies, than
heaven for souls?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Never fuller of who made such a man a cuckold, and who poxâ€™d
such a woman, as now; neither were ever the women half so impudent; no
not in the reigns of <i>Caligula</i> and <i>Nero</i>. Never was debauchery so much
in fashion; nor never were the whores so often coverâ€™d with purple.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Is there not in your herd, such a thing as a tame gentle
weather? or what <i>Virgil</i> calls <i>Dux Gregis</i>? you understand me.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> A weather! oh, fy, fy! not such a creature among them, I can
assure you. The most christian king would not suffer such an impertinent
scandalous animal, so much as at shew his head in his seraglio. â€™Tis as
easy to find there a pretty woman chaste, or hair in the palm of your
hand, as an emasculated beast among the mitred hogs: for the <i>Dux
Gregis</i>, <i>Virgil</i> speaks of, we have one at the head of our prelates,
who has all the qualities requisite for so great an honour, thoâ€™ he has
neither beard nor horns: and should I name him, youâ€™d be of my opinion.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Wouâ€™d I recollect my memory, and their virtues, I couâ€™d guess
within two or three; but pray save me that labour.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Do you not remember a famous song you made in praise of a sick
wanton goat. <i>Creque fait &amp; defend lâ€™archeveque de RoÃ¼en.</i></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh, dear! oh, dear! the right reverend <i>Francis Harley</i>,
archbishop of <i>Paris</i>! my most renowned friend! a worthy chief!</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The very same, and â€™tis a precious jewel, both for body and
soul. A hedgehog has not more bristles than<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">{106}</a></span> this prelate has
mistresses, and thereâ€™s not a stallion in <i>France</i> that leaps oftner.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> You rejoice my heart Mons. <i>Furetiere</i>. He was, I remember,
always at <i>Paris</i>, when archbishop of <i>Rouen</i>: no man fitter for that
employment. To be free, if <i>Paris</i> be the hell of hackney horses, â€™tis
the paradice of whore-masters and hackney-whores. I can guess at what he
does now, by what he did formerly. Several ladies also of our
neighbouring countries are witnesses of his prowess; but more especially
some of the fair <i>English</i> ladies; the luscious morsels of a lustful
monarch. But on to the rest.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> I am willing to satisfy your curiosity, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, but to
run throâ€™ the whole herd, would be too tedious at present, thoâ€™ they all
deserve to be chronicled: so I will only, <i>en passant</i>, give you the
history of those you have heard preach, both at <i>Paris</i> and the court,
with wonderful applause; and who, for their modesty and regular lives,
had the reputation of saints, whilst they were only fathers of oratory.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Take your own method, Mons. <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>; but let me tell you one
thing, by the way, this place is callâ€™d the <i>wits corner</i>, but by some
late guests, because of the smoak and liquor, the <i>wits Coffee-House</i>.
Now you know the wits of all countries laugh at the clergy in their
poems and plays; and that the clergy, to be revengâ€™d of them, and keep
up their own reputation with the ignorant, call them atheists; therefore
you may freely give a true description of them. All here are their
enemies; and a priest would as soon venture his carcass in <i>Sweden</i> as
in this place; he dreads a poet, as much as dogs do a sow-gelder.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Still a merry man, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>. But to return to your mitred
hogs; do you remember father <i>le Bone</i>, and father <i>Mascron</i>. The first
is now bishop of <i>Perigueux</i>, and the other bishop of <i>Agen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> How! are these two famous preachers, those scourgers of pride
and immorality, got into the herd of the mitred hogs? by my troth, I
always took them for credulous humble weathers, believers of what they
preached; thoâ€™ I know most priests seldom believe what they profess.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Well, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, thoâ€™ you can see as far throâ€™ a mill-stone
as any man, yet I find you are not infallible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Faith, a man sees as far throâ€™ a mill-stone, as a priestâ€™s
surplice, thoâ€™ â€™tis reckonâ€™d the emblem of purity. But, Mons. <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>,
what <i>Montaigne</i> said formerly of the women, I now say of the priests:
<i>Ils envoyen leur conscience au bordel, &amp; tiennent leur countenance en
regle</i>: they send their conscience to the stews, and keep their
countenance within rule.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> â€™Tis even as true of one, as of the other, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, and
my following discourse will verify it. What virtue there is in a mitre,
I know not, for I could never obtain one; I was thought too good a
christian in the bottom; but before I had bad adieu to <i>Paris</i>, your
innocent believing apostles were become too as rampant and fine coated
hogs as any of the herd. The reverend father <i>le Bone</i>, bishop of
<i>Perigueux</i>, has so bravely plaid the county boar, that thereâ€™s not a
pretty nun in his diocese but has been with pig by him; as I have been
credibly informed by persons of honour.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh! the excellent apostle: I remember a story of him when he was
bishop of <i>Agde</i>, which will not be unpleasant to you, if you can bear
with a pun, and a poetâ€™s making merry with several languages, a thing he
can no more avoid than flattery. This worthy prelate not meeting with
that plenty at <i>Agde</i> his voluptuousness required, made his monarch this
compliment: Sir, <i>Je suis nÃ© gueux, jâ€™ay vecu gueux, benais sâ€™il plait a
votre majeste, je voux Perigueux</i>.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Faith, a very comfortable reward for a very filthy pun; I have
said forty pleasanter things to the king, and never could get beyond
Mons. <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>, which makes me believe there is a critical minute for a
wit, as well as love: an excellent <i>Roman</i> poet was sensible of it, when
he said,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><i>Hora libellorum decima est, Eupheme, meorum,</i><br />
<i>Temporat ambrosias cum tua cura dapes,</i><br />
<i>Est bonus Ã¦thereo laxatur nectare CÃ¦sare.</i></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Thereâ€™s a <i>Latin</i> quotation for you, to shew you I understand it; and
that I have been an author as well as you.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Believe me, Mons. <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>, youâ€™ll fare much the better for it
here; and thoâ€™ those gentlemen made us poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_108">{108}</a></span> poets pass for scoundrels
and impious ridiculers of piety in the other world, yet we have much the
whip-hand of them in these quarters, therefore take comfort. Tell me
pray how the pious <i>Julius Mascaron</i> behaves himself at <i>Agen</i>, where he
meets with greater plenty than he did at <i>Thute</i>.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Oh! the acorns and chesnuts of <i>Agen</i> have made him so plump
and wanton, â€™twould rejoice your heart to see him. All the females of
the town caress him, and strive which shall yield him most delight; and
he out of zeal and gratitude, and to preserve peace and charity among
them, like a holy prelate, has given to each her hour of rendezvous,
which they keep as regularly as the clock strikes.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Very well! thereâ€™s nothing so commendable as good method in
whoring.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> But his favourite is a pretty gentle <i>nun</i>, with whom he often
goes to <i>Beauregard</i>, there <i>tete a tete</i>, or rather <i>ne a ne</i>, under
the shady limes, do they both act that which will one day procure a
third. There are forty other better stories of these two prelates; for
they value not what common report says. They are above it: But if you
will listen to the exploits of the bishop of <i>Laon</i>, now cardinal
<i>dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i>, I will shew you what a mitred hog is capable of.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> As I am acquainted with the strength of his genius, so I do not
doubt of the greatness of his performances. You have now named a man
that would make a parish bull jealous.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The history I shall give you, will justify your opinion of him.
Know then that the cardinal <i>dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i> being passionately in love with
the marchioness <i>de CÅ“uvres</i>, who was supposed to have granted the duke
<i>de Seaux</i> the liberty of rifling her placket, was resolvâ€™d to put in
for his snack. To compass this, he acquainted his nephew, the marquis
<i>de CÅ“uvres</i>, with the scandalous familiarity that was between the duke
and his wife. Upon which their parents met at the mareschal
<i>dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i>â€™s, where it was concluded to send the young adultress into a
convent; but the old mareschal, made wiser by long experience, was
against it. In good faith, said he, you are more nice than wise; had not
our mothers plaid the same wanton trick, not one<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_109">{109}</a></span> of us had been here. I
know very well what I say; thereâ€™s not a handsome nose nor leg in the
company, but has been stole; and not a farthing matter from whom,
whether prince or coachman, it has mended our breed: therefore we have
more reason to praise those, who discreetly follow the examples of their
grandmothers and mothers, than banish â€™em, and so render them fruitless.
Do not suppose, when I married my grandson <i>de CÅ“uvres</i>, to young
mademoiselle <i>de Lionne</i>, that I considerâ€™d her riches, or that her
father was a minister of state; such thoughts are beneath a man of my
age and experience. My great hopes were, that she being young and
handsome, will still support the grandeur of our family, which as you
all very well know, has been made more considerable by the intrigues of
the women, than by the valour of the men. Iâ€™m sure I never discouragâ€™d
what I now maintain; and why my grandson should be more squeamish than
I, or his forefathers have been, I take it to be unreasonable:
therefore, since the marchioness <i>de CÅ“uvres</i> is only blamâ€™d for having
tasted those pleasures which nature allows, and which are customary in
our family, I declare my self her protector. Yet I would not have this
be the talk of the court; I would not have it pass my threshold; because
the world might say of one of us, as of a fine curious piece of
clock-work, that a great many excellent workmen had a hand in it.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> In this generous and considerate speech, do I plainly discover
the inclinations of the famous <i>Gabriele dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i>, <i>Harry</i> the fourthâ€™s
mistress. But I am in trouble for the poor marchioness; I know a convent
must be insupportable to a woman that has tasted the pleasures of a
licentious court.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The cardinal was against publishing his nieceâ€™s wantonness, as
well as the mareschal, and took upon him the care of reprimanding her,
and bringing her into the path of virtue: to which the marquis <i>de
CÅ“uvres</i> readily consented, not imagining he deliverâ€™d the pretty lamb
to the ravenous wolf. This being agreed on, the lustful prelate went
immediately to his niece; I come, Madam, said he, from doing you a very
considerable piece of service: all our family has been in consultation
against you, and could think of no milder punishment for you than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_110">{110}</a></span>
convent, with all its mortifications, <i>viz.</i> <i>Praying, fasting,
whipping, and abstaining from the masculine kind</i>, &amp;c. I know, dear
niece, this was as unjust as severe; but, in short, it had been your
doom, had I not been your friend. Such a piece of service as this,
beautiful niece, deserves a suitable return, and I believe you too
generous to be ungrateful: but I shall think this, and all the other
services I can render you, highly recompencâ€™d, if youâ€™ll but permit me
to see you often, and embrace you.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> A very pious speech! I hope that which is to follow will answer
this excellent beginning. Now do I imagine a place formally besieged;
the next news will be of the opening the trenches.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> We proceed very regularly, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>; the place makes a
noble defence, and does not surrender till a breach is made. To be thus
unjustly accused, said the marchioness, is a very great misfortune; and
thoâ€™ I will not disown my obligation to you, yet you must permit me to
say, that your proceeding destroys that very obligation: if you will not
have any regard to my virtue, and the fidelity I owe to my husband, you
ought, nevertheless, to remember your character, and how nearly we are
related. But I know the meaning of this; you believe the scandalous and
malicious story that has been raised of me, and design to make your
advantage of it. What can be more injurious than this attempt! Thoâ€™ you
thought me a whore, had you but thought me still virtuous enough to
abhor your beastly, incestuous proposition, I should have had some
reason to esteem you&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Poor prelate! Egad, I pity thee; thou hast receivâ€™d such a
bruise in this repulse, that I cannot think thou wilt have the courage
to return to the attack.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Have patience; you are not acquainted with the craft and
courage of a <i>mitred hog</i>. The prelate, who by this resistance, was
become more amorous, resolvâ€™d to watch so narrowly his nieceâ€™s conduct,
that he would oblige her to do that out of fear, which all his rhetorick
and protestations of love could not tempt her to. To be short, he
managed so well this important affair, that he surprisâ€™d the duke <i>de
Seaux</i> in bed, between Madam <i>de Lionne</i> and the marchioness <i>de
CÅ“uvres</i> her daughter:<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_111">{111}</a></span> and to magnify charity, as well as other virtues
in this matter, he took Monsieur <i>de Lionne</i> along with him. I will
leave you to imagine the confusion of these two ladies; the first to see
her husband, and the other the man she had so vigorously repulsâ€™d. The
marchioness thinking wisely, her compliance would yet conceal her
intrigue; taking the cardinal by the hand, and gently squeezing it,
said, If youâ€™ll promise to appease my father, and by your ghostly
authority, make my mother and him good friends again, and keep this
frolick from my husband, you shall, whenever you please, find me
grateful, and sensible of your affection.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> What said Monsieur <i>de Lionne</i>? The surprise of a poor cuckold,
who finds a handsome, brawny young fellow in bed with his wife and
daughter, surpasses my imagination.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> If, like <i>ActÃ¦on</i>, he had been immediately metamorphosed into a
stag, he could not have been more surprized.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> How did the prelate behave himself after this charitable brave
exploit? The breach is now made, there has been a parley; the
preliminaries are agreed on; nothing now is wanting, but taking
possession of the place.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> You move very soldier like, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>. The prelate being
resolvâ€™d to perform all the articles of the treaty, like a man of
honour, first preachâ€™d on charity, and then forgiveness of crimes; then
on human prudence, policy, the reputation of their family, and quoted
some of the old mareschalâ€™s remarks; which altogether so prevailâ€™d on
the poor cuckold, that he consented to put his horns in his pocket, and
forgive his daughter. Then did the prelate, under the pious pretence of
correcting his faulty niece, lead her with a seeming austere gravity
into his chamber, where he summonâ€™d her to the performance of articles
on her part; which, on a couch, were reciprocally exchanged; she not
daring to refuse it, for fear he should acquaint her husband with her
intrigue with the duke <i>de Seaux</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh brave hog! worthy prelate! pious cardinal. What a fine way of
mortification is this! Well, for sincerity, humility, charity, sobriety,
<i>&amp;c.</i> commend me to a prelate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The cardinal, thoâ€™ he had obtained his desires, yet could not
but be sensible that fear, not love, made her consent; therefore
doubting she would return to her first amours, or that he should have
but little share of her, so contrivâ€™d it, that her husband sent her to a
house he had in the cardinalâ€™s diocese, and not far from his palace.
This had a very good effect; because the cardinal, for the love of her,
resided always in his diocese. Thus did the cardinal and his niece live
very lovingly for two or three years; but the intrigues of the court
calling the prelate out of the kingdom, ambition steppâ€™d into the place
of love, and put an end to an incestuous commerce, to which the
marchioness had first consented, purely in her own defence.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I find there are hogs with cardinal caps, as well as mitres. But
I believe they are not so numerous; that dignity, perhaps, is a kind of
curb to their licentiousness.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> You mistake the matter, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, inclination never
changes; the only reason is, there are more bishops than cardinals, and
most of them reside at <i>Rome</i>, at glorious <i>Rome</i>, which is but one
entire stew; <i>Sodom</i> was not what <i>Rome</i> is now. Have you forgot the
famous cardinal <i>Bonzi</i>? He is as absolute in <i>Montpelier</i>, as the grand
signior in his seraglio; he needs but beckon to the dame he has a mind
to enjoy. The brave cardinal <i>de Bouillon</i>, notwithstanding his court
intrigues is as well known in all the bawdy-houses of <i>Paris</i>, as a
young debauchâ€™d musqetteer, or <i>garde de corps</i>. The cardinal <i>de
Furstenburg</i> too was as wicked as his purse would allow him before I
left the town.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I verily believe it, Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>: But pray give me leave
to reckon your dignities upon my fingers, that I may not forget them.
First, There is your porkers of <i>Jesus Christ</i>; then your <i>mitred hogs</i>;
and lastly, your <i>purple hogs</i>. â€™Tis wondrous pretty! pray how must we
distinguish the Pope, who is chief of this herd? Must we call him the
swine-herd? Some of them, â€™tis true, were swine-herds before they took
the order of priesthood, as <i>Sixtus Quintus</i>, who was swine-herd to the
village of <i>Montaste</i>: But there is another thing that puzzles me worse
than all this: you know <i>Lewis</i> XIV. calls<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_113">{113}</a></span> himself the eldest son of
St. <i>Peter</i>, <i>Lewis the Great</i> then, for all his ambition is the son of
a swine-herd. Well, I know not how to settle this point; therefore pray
continue your history.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Iâ€™ll make an end of my history, if you are not already glutted
with the infamy of the afore-mentioned prelates; with that of the
archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> How! Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>, how! Is he a hog too? I have heard him
callâ€™d by some of our new guests a horse.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> You are in the right of that: the mareschal <i>de la Feuillade</i>
was his god-father, and one day honourâ€™d him with the title of
coach-horse.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> A horse is a degree of honour above a hog&#8212;&#8212; Has <i>la Feuillade</i>
the privilege of distributing titles at the court of <i>France</i>? Has he
more wit than in cardinal <i>Mazarine</i>â€™s days, who always greeted him in
these words, Monsieur <i>de la Feuillade, All your brains would lie in a
nutshell</i>.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> â€™Tis true, there is no more substance in his brains, than in
whipt cream; and as that fills up the desart, and serves to cool and
refresh the stomach after a plentiful dinner; so does he serve to unbend
and divert the mind, after solid conversation and business. To prove
this, I will tell you how he made the king to laugh very heartily,
concerning the archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> As a wise politick lady, when she has not the fool her husband
to divert her, will have her monkey; so must the great statesman have
his buffoon. He is the same to the politician as a clyster is to the man
thatâ€™s costive. But go on with your story.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> He being one day with the king, looking out at a window of
<i>Versailles</i>, that faces the great road to <i>Paris</i>, and observing the
passengers, the king at last discoverâ€™d a coach with more, as he
thought, than six horses; and turning to <i>la Feuillade</i>, praising the
equipage, askâ€™d him if it was not the archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>â€™s livery:
yes, Sir, said <i>la Feuillade</i>. I can discover but seven horses, replyâ€™d
the king: Oh! Sir, said <i>la Feuillade</i>, the eighth is in the coach. But
I pretend to degrade this archbishop, and prove that heâ€™s but a <i>mitred
hog</i> as well as the rest of his brethren.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">{114}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Ah dear Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>, for the love of Monsieur <i>le
Tellier</i>, who has renderâ€™d his king and country such great service, take
not from him the honour <i>la Feuillade</i> conferrâ€™d on him, and with the
kingâ€™s approbation.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Plead not so earnestly for him, but hear me with patience. I do
not say but the archbishop of <i>Rheims</i> is a brute, a very animal, a
coach-horse, <i>per omnes casus</i>; but yet he pursues the affairs of love
with as much zeal, and as little conscience, as any prelate in <i>Europe</i>,
therefore must not be distinguishâ€™d from his brethren. Besides, if you
take him from his lawful title of <i>mitred hog</i>, you will hinder his
preferment.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh! by no means. I have read that <i>Caligula</i> honourâ€™d one of his
horses with the title of senator; why then may not the Pope, who is the
successor of that emperor, call into his senate your coach-horse?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> With all my heart. Nevertheless, Iâ€™ll call him if you please,
<i>mitred hog</i>, as I did the bishop of <i>Loan</i> before he was cardinal
<i>dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i>. Now to matter of fact. The duchess <i>dâ€™Aumont</i> having
surprisâ€™d one of her chamber-maids in a very indecent posture with the
marquis <i>de Villequier</i>, her son-in-law, turnâ€™d her out of her service.
The poor wench, distracted to find herself separated from her lover,
told him, out of pure revenge, that the archbishop of <i>Rheims</i> lay with
the duchess every time the duke went to <i>Versailles</i>. How! my uncle! Ah!
I cannot believe it; thou sayâ€™st this out of malice.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh fie! oh fie! The archbishop of <i>Rheims</i> debauch the duchess
<i>dâ€™Aumont</i>, his brother-in-lawâ€™s wife! Do not you plainly perceive this
jadeâ€™s malice? If the duchess had but sufferâ€™d her intrigue with the
marquis, she would not have openâ€™d her mouth. Oh, horrible! Oh,
horrible!</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> As much as you seem to wonder now, and abhor the thoughts of
such doings, you were not formerly so nice, nor incredulous.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Be not angry, good Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>; I do believe as bad of a
priest, as you can desire to have me; therefore pray continue.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> By what follows youâ€™ll find that the spirit of revenge
discoverâ€™d a most luscious intrigue. Since you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_115">{115}</a></span> will not believe what I
say, replyâ€™d the wench to her gallant, I will, the next time the duke
goes to <i>Versailles</i>, make your eyes convince you. The duchess, you must
know, had imprudently given her leave to stay three or four days in her
house. As it happenâ€™d, the duke went that afternoon to court, who was no
sooner gone, and the marquis placâ€™d in a dark room leading to the
duchessâ€™s bed-chamber, but by comes the archbishop, muffled up with a
dark-lanthorn in his hand. This convinced the young marquis, and was
enough to convince a more incredulous man than your worship.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> It was perhaps some phantome, or some amorous Devil, who to do
himself honour, had taken the archbishopâ€™s goodly form and sanctifyâ€™d
mien.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Still excusing the priests! You were not such an advocate of
theirs in the other world, witness your answer to your parish-priest,
some few hours before you packâ€™d up for this place.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> I have since drank a swinging draught of <i>Lethe</i>â€™s forgetful
stream; I remember nothing of it: You would, perhaps, scandalize me.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> It was thus, Sir, the grave hypocrite administring the last
idolatrous ceremonies, asked if you knew what you received; to which you
made this short answer: <i>The body of your God carried by an ass</i>.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> â€™Tis true, â€™tis true, Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>; pray who can endure to
be disturbâ€™ by an impertinent coxcomb, when heâ€™s going to take a long
voyage? But go on, I will not speak one word more in their behalf.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The marquis, convinced by what he had seen, went the next
morning to <i>Versailles</i>, and told all the young nobility of his
acquaintance what had passâ€™d; which by being buzzâ€™d about, in four and
twenty hours became the talk of all the court.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Oh brave archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>! Was no body worthy of being
made a cuckold by you, but your brother in-law?</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Again mistaken, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, for the charitable archbishop
has assisted his nephew too, as well as his brother-in-law, and intends
to go round the family.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> The Devil! This is the most insatiable hog I ever heard of! He
devours both the hen and her chickens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_116">{116}</a></span> Pray excuse me, Monsieur
<i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>: I cannot but think you wrong him now.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> You may judge of that by the following relation. The archbishop
being passionately in love with Madam <i>dâ€™Aumont</i> his niece, and the
marquis <i>de Crequi</i>â€™s wife, was resolvâ€™d, the better to insinuate
himself with her, to make her jealous of her husband, which he found no
difficult matter to do. This done, he went to visit her, and finding her
melancholy, said, Madam, I know no reason you have to be so much
concernâ€™d at your husbandâ€™s infidelity, since it lies in your power to
be revengâ€™d. If he has a mistress, why donâ€™t you get a gallant? I know
no injustice in it; and it is the only recompensing counsel I can give
you.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Ah! <i>Marchioness</i>, have at you; I find the hog grows
rampant&#8212;&#8212; Go on, good Sir, this is like a brave metropolitan.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> The young marchioness did not listen to this proportion; but on
the contrary, was surprisâ€™d to find her uncle, an archbishop, make a
motion, which had she been inclined to follow, he ought to have given
her more virtuous advice. Perceiving her aversion to his proposition, he
suspected she might suppose he only said it to try her inclinations,
therefore he was resolved to declare his mind in more intelligible
terms; which he did in so amorous a style, that the marchioness plainly
perceivâ€™d the archbishop intended to have a share in the revenge. But
the young lady, thoâ€™ she would not have made any scruple of it, had it
not been for his character, was infinitely concerned at it.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Notwithstanding all this, do I see the purple victorious, and
the poor victim prostrate.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> As the archbishop made her frequent presents, and she expected
great advantages at his death, so she did not think it prudence to
mortify him too much; this filled him with hopes, and made him more
amorous: therefore, to blind the husband, and have a better opportunity
of lying with his wife, he proposed taking them into his palace, and
defraying all their charges.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Money is the sinew of love as well as war. The poor marquis, I
donâ€™t doubt, was blinded with this fine proposal. More men are made
cuckolds by their own follies than by their wives.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> So it proved by our cuckold, who was so transported at the
bounteous offer of the archbishop, supposing it an uncleâ€™s kindness, not
a loverâ€™s, that he every where boasted of it, that is to say, he thought
himself obligâ€™d to his uncle for lying with his wife at that price. The
mareschal <i>de Crequi</i>, his father, had quite another opinion of that
matter, and was affronted at the excessive liberalities of the
archbishop, knowing that the most devout and zealous of their tribe were
adulterers, incestuous, and sodomites. He complainâ€™d of it to the
marquis <i>Louvois</i>, who told him, covetousness was the reason of his
complaint. The mareschal not satisfied with this answer, went to the
king, who immediately commanded the archbishop to retire into his
diocese. The disconsolate archbishop, whilst all were preparing for his
journey, went to visit his niece, and with tears desired her ever to
remember, that it was for the love of her he was banishâ€™d.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> Could the afflictions of the living affect me, I shouâ€™d be
mightily concernâ€™d for the grief this poor prelate, who was obligâ€™d to
leave so dear, so pretty a niece; a niece that afforded him so much
pleasure and delight. Have not you left behind you other <i>mitred hogs</i>,
whose lives and conversations are worthy your remembrance? Those you
have already been so kind to relate, have been a banquet to me; and I
heartily wish I may always meet with such entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> Your servant, Mr. <i>Scarron</i>, I am extremely pleased they have
diverted you; and that you may promise yourself such another
entertainment, nay, twenty such; be assurâ€™d, that there is not a bishop,
archbishop, or cardinal, that is not as very a hog, as either the
archbishop of <i>Rheims</i>, or cardinal <i>dâ€™EstrÃ©e</i>, except the bishop of
<i>Escar</i>, who lives in a barren soil, and can scarce afford himself a
bellyfull of chesnuts above once in fifteen days. Poverty is a kind of
leprosy, not a fair sleek female will come near him. The reason why I
entertain you with the histories of these two prelates, rather than of
the archbishop of <i>Paris</i>, the bishop of <i>Meaux</i>, the bishop of
<i>Beauvais</i>, the bishop of <i>Valence</i>, and all the other bishops, is,
because having heard the famous actions of those worthy metropolitans,
faithfully related some few days before my de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_118">{118}</a></span>parture, those ideas are
the most present and lively. But in time, and with a little rubbing up
my memory, I may be able to give you the lives of all the <i>mitred hogs</i>.
Besides, as we have now settled three couriers weekly from this place to
<i>Versailles</i>, because of the importance of affairs now on foot, I expect
now and then a pacquet; so I donâ€™t doubt of keeping my word, and often
diverting you with stories of the like nature, and of fresher date.</p>

<p><i>Scar.</i> â€™Tis very obliging, Monsieur <i>lâ€™AbbÃ©</i>: But your last paragraph
has put an odd whim into my noddle. This place, as I told you before, is
now callâ€™d the wits coffee-house; none but authors are sent hither. What
think you if we should join our heads together, and digest all your
stories and intelligence into form; if we should compile a book of them,
we could make it very diverting, having able men both for verse and
prose, whose very names would give it the reputation of a faithful
history, because the dead neither hoping nor fearing any thing from the
living, cannot be suspected of flattery and partiality, as they justly
were when in the world.</p>

<p><i>Furet.</i> I protest, a noble thought! The lives of the <i>Roman</i> prelates
will make a most curious history. We have a famous history of the
<i>Roman</i> emperors; and why should we not then have another of the <i>Roman</i>
prelates, since they as justly deserve to be transmitted to posterity?</p>

<p><i>Dearly beloved Brothers of the Orange-Butter-Box.</i></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU will soon be satisfyâ€™d what mighty changes we suffer by death; and
that there is no two things at more distance from one another, than to
be and not to be. You know how, <i>Roman</i> like, I took pett, and darâ€™d to
die! for time had bejaded me a little, and to renounce the tyranny of
the fickle goddess, I was obligâ€™d to renounce your light. Since my
arrival at the grim <i>Tartarian</i> territories, I have received the usual
compliments of the place; and thoâ€™ the most accurate courtiers that
ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_119">{119}</a></span> was bred at <i>Versailles</i>, and all the wits of the most gallant
courts in the universe, are here in whole shoals; yet to my great wonder
and amazement, not one of them said a genteel thing to me. But with a
strange familiar air, that favourâ€™d much of our bear-garden friendship,
some a hundred or two, hallâ€™d me by the ears, and puffing out thick
clouds of flaming sulphur, cryâ€™d all with a hoarse and dismal voice,
well, <i>Doily</i>, this was kindly done of thee, to take <i>pas avance</i> of
destiny, and shew the world, that no man need be miserable, but who is
afraid to die.</p>

<p>I was (amongst friends) as much out of countenance at this saucy
proceeding, as when our old friends, <i>Shore</i> and <i>la Rocha</i>, refusâ€™d to
lend me five paultry guineas, after I had equippâ€™d them with more than
one thousand apiece. I wonderâ€™d at the roughness of their <i>acueil</i>, and
they burst out a laughing at the impertinency of my astonishment. Well,
gentlemen, give me leave to tell you, that if I had but suspected a
quarter part of this inhuman and ungentleman-like reception, I would
have suspended the honours of my self-sacrifice, and have chosen rather
to wait the fatal period of life in a more contracted orb, than thus
suddenly have plungâ€™d myself into such a disappointment. After having
allotted me my portion for my vanity and foppery, and I had been put
into possession of my shop, you cannot conceive how heavy it lay upon my
spirits; but suffer it I must; and if it had not been the odiousest and
most abominable, most nauseous, and most execrable function I could have
laboured under, they would not have been so merciful as to have enjoinâ€™d
it me. â€™Twas long before I could obtain leave to insinuate thus much to
you; for they are no ways here below inclined to grant any the minutest
thing imaginable, that may contribute to the benefit of mankind. <i>Jo.
Haines</i> came to me, (and his breath had as much augmented its stench, as
light is different from darkness: In a word, there was as great
disproportion for the worse, as between us and you) and with a displayed
pair of chaps, told me, I must not have any correspondency with the
upper regions, for it might tend to the dispeopling the <i>Acherontic</i>
territories; and that I was a bubble to think they had not as much of
self-interest here below, as any merchant, statesman, lawyer, or
nobleman in all the dominions above. But seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_120">{120}</a></span> my and your old
acquaintance, (gentlemen) I took heart a little, and held my nose; and
after some usual ceremonies, (to which he made but a scurvy return) I
told him, look you Mr <i>Haines</i>, you know, as well as I, that those
powderâ€™d members of the vain fraternity are all of them incorrigible;
present smart and future fear affects them not; they are out of the
reach of good advice; reason was never their talent; for if they were
ever in election to have a thought, as it would be the first, so would
it be the fatalest too. Could any glass but shew them to themselves as
really they are, they would all despair like me, and die like me. A sly
young whelp of the second class of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s footmen, said, well, Mr.
<i>Haines</i>, there may be much in what he says, he came last from thence,
therefore let him make an end of his epistle, it may turn to better
account than we are aware of. I thankâ€™d the gentleman for his civility,
and would have administred a half-crown; but you know (my worthy
brothers) that the last twelve shillings I had was laid out in three
glasses of <i>Ratifia</i>, and a bottle of <i>Essence</i>; with which, I first
combâ€™d out my wig, then cleanâ€™d my shoes, and then oilâ€™d the locks of my
pistols, and so set out for this tedious and lugubrous journey: and that
you may see, that <i>Pluto</i>â€™s skip-kennels are not so insolent as yours
are, the fellow told me, with a malicious smile, that if the powderâ€™d
gentry of the other world were so very despicable animals, as I
represented them, he would take a small tour with me, and then I might
have something material to communicate to them.</p>

<p>We had not walkâ€™d so far as from the chocolate-house to the <i>Rose</i>, but
in a narrow, obscure, obscene alley, there hung out a piece of a broken
chamber-pot, upon which was written in sulphurous characters, <i>Fleshly
relief for the sons of</i> Adam. I had hardly made an end of reading this
merry motto, but the door openâ€™d, and what should my eyes behold, but a
reverend lady, of illustrious charms, that gave us too visible proofs of
the depredations of time: I recollected her phiz, as engineers tell by
the very ruins, whether the fabric were <i>Doric</i> or <i>Ionic</i>, &amp;c. and who
should this be but the celebrated fair <i>Rosamond</i>; her present
occupation was to be runner to this bawdy coffee-house. Queen <i>Eleanor</i>,
her mortal enemy, sells sprats, and has</p>

<p class="nind">her stall in <i>Pluto</i>â€™s stable-yard. In my peregrination, I met several
things unexpected, and therefore surprising; I shall not give you the
trouble of every particular dark passage we went throâ€™, but in general
terms relate the most memorable things that occurred during a very
considerable walk that we had together. Taking a solitary walk on the
gloomy banks of <i>Acheron</i>, I met a finical fellow, powderâ€™d from top to
toe, his hands in his pocket, <i>a-la-mode de Paris</i>, humming a new
minuet; and who would it be, but <i>Gondamour</i>, that famous <i>Spaniard</i>.
<i>Helen</i> of <i>Greece</i> cryâ€™d kitchin-stuff, and <i>Roxano</i> had a little
basket of tripe and trotters; <i>Agamemnon</i> sold bakâ€™d ox-cheek, hot, hot;
<i>Hannibal</i> sells <i>Spanish</i>-nuts, come crack it away; the so famous
<i>Hector</i> of <i>Troy</i> is a head-dresser; the <i>Decii</i> keep a coblers-stall,
in the corner of the <i>Forum</i>, and the <i>Horatii</i> a chandlerâ€™s-shop;
<i>Sardanapalus</i> cries lilly-white-vinegar, and <i>Heliogabalus</i> bakes
fritters, in the <i>via appia</i> of this metropolis; <i>Lucius Ã†milius Paulus</i>
is a bayliffâ€™s follower, and the famous queen <i>Thomyris</i> proportions out
the offals for <i>Cerberus</i>; <i>Tarquin</i> sweeps his den, and <i>Romulus</i> is a
turnspit in <i>Pluto</i>â€™s kitchen; <i>Artaxerxes</i> is an under scullion, and
<i>Pompey</i> the magnificent, a rag-man; <i>Mark Anthony</i>, that disputed his
mistress at the price of the whole universe, goes now about with
dancing-dogs, a monkey and a rope; <i>Cleopatra</i>, that could swallow a
province at one draught, when it was to drink her loverâ€™s health,
submits now to the humble employment of feeding <i>Proserpine</i>â€™s pigs:
that luxurious <i>Roman</i>, who was once so dissolvâ€™d in ease, as that a
very rose-leaf doubled under him, prevented his rest, is now labouring
at the anvil with a half hundred hammer; <i>Oliver Cromwell</i> is a
rat-catcher, and my lord <i>Bellew</i> a chimney-sweeper.</p>

<p>There was besides these, a list of people nearer hand; but you may
easily guess upon what score they are left out of the list. We needed
not have gone so far back in the records of persons and things, to have
met instances of barbarity, luxury, avarice, lust of dominion, as well
as of sensuality. Malversations of government in sovereigns and
subjects; publick justice avoided, private feuds fomented, every thing
sacrificed to a <i>Colbert</i>, <i>Maintenon</i>, or a <i>LoÃ¼is</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<p>There is somebody hollows most damnably on the other side of <i>Styx</i>, and
lest I lose this opportunity, I shall only relate some memorable things
to you: Therefore pray pardon me that I cannot dilate upon every
particular. In short then, <i>Alexander</i> the Great is bully to a
guinea-dropper; and cardinal <i>Mazarine</i> keeps a nine-holes; <i>Mary</i> of
<i>Medicis</i> foots stockings, and <i>Katherine</i>, queen of <i>Sweedland</i> cries
two bunches a penny card-matches, two bunches a penny; <i>Henry</i> the
fourth of <i>France</i> carries a rary-show; and <i>Mahomet</i>, muscles; <i>Seneca</i>
keeps a fencing-school, and <i>Julius CÃ¦sar</i> a two-penny ordinary;
<i>Xenophon</i>, that great philosopher, cries cucumbers to pickle; and
<i>Cato</i> is the perfectest Sir <i>Courtly</i> of the whole <i>Plutonian</i> kingdom;
<i>Richelieu</i> cries topping bunno; and the late pope, any thing to day;
<i>Lewis</i> the thirteenth is a corn-cutter; <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> cries
sparrowgrass, with a thousand more particulars of this nature. You must
allow the scenes to be mightily alterâ€™d from their former stations; but
alas! Sir, this change we suffer, and as pleasure is the reward of
virtue, so disgrace and infamy is of cruelty, pride, and hypocrisy. What
can be more surprising than to see the renowned <i>Penthefilea</i>, queen of
the <i>Amazons</i>, crying new almanacks, and <i>Darius</i> gingerbread, <i>van
Trump</i> cries ballads, and admiral <i>de Ruyter</i> long and strong
thread-laces.</p>

<p>This disproportion is their punishment; for it must be anxious to the
last degree, to fall so low even beyond a possibility of rising again.
That is the advantage of moving in an humble sphere; they are not
capable of those enormities that the great ones can hardly avoid; for
temptation will generally have the better of mankind.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E had a fierce debate here on the 13th <i>passato</i>, between my lord
<i>Fitz-Walter</i>, Sir <i>Simon Mountford</i>, Sir <i>William Stanley</i>, and myself;
whether by a parity of reason, <i>England</i> might not once more have the
same card trumpt up upon them? In a word, we were consulting your
affairs, and they were most of â€™em of opinion, that there could not be
any good success expected from your personal endowments, and princely
qualifications. For you must give me leave to tell you, <i>Cuz</i>, that I
was a smart child, and a smock-facâ€™d youth; I had not the good luck to
kill a wild boar at your years, but I could sit the great horse before I
could go alone, I had all the advantages of friends that you have, and
the interest of my good aunt the duchess or <i>Burgundy</i>, let me tell you,
was as capable of seconding me, as the house of <i>Modena</i> is you: Nay, I
had the <i>Scotch</i> on my side, assistance from <i>Ireland</i>, and not without
a party, you see, even in <i>England</i> too. But the <i>English</i> mob is the
most giddy, wretched, senseless mob of all the mobs in the world. How
they crowded into me at <i>Whitsand-Bay</i>, and in their first fury fought
well enough before <i>Exeter</i>: But when they heard of an army coming
against â€™em, the scoundrels ran away and left me; all my blooming hopes
and fancied kingdoms dwindled away in a sanctuary, that I exchanged for
a prison, and brought my <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, and so turnâ€™d myself over to

Simnel</i> and I, drank your health tâ€™other morning in a curious cup of

brother of <i>Wales</i> succeed him in this great employment at court;
continually turning a spit would harden and inure you, and so prepare
you for these smoaky and warmer climates: not but that there is matter
of speculation in it too. The turning a spit is an emblem of the
vicissitude of human affairs. But before I take my leave, good<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_124">{124}</a></span> cousin,
I must offer a little of my advice to you, if it be possible any ways to
meliorate your destiny; and that is, that you would make a campaign or
two in <i>Italy</i>: Marshal <i>Villeroy</i> will shew you what it is to be well
beaten; and till then youâ€™ll never be a great general. But <i>Charon</i> is
just landing a multitude of <i>French</i> from those parts; I must go see
what news, and inform myself further of your welfare and prosperity.</p>

<p><i>My lord</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>N the 25th <i>passato</i>, there happenâ€™d a very considerable dispute in the
<i>Delphick</i> vale; the <i>literati</i> had hard words, and it was fearâ€™d by
<i>Pluto</i> himself, that the angry shades would come to somewhat worse. It
may be you in those grosser regions, do not believe that we here below
lose nothing of ourselves by death, but the terrene part: nay, the very
soul itself retains some of those unhappy impressions it receivâ€™d from
flesh and blood. Here <i>CÃ¦sar</i> bites his thumbs when <i>Alexander</i> walks
by; frowns upon <i>Brutus</i>, and blushes when he talks of king <i>William</i>:
The great <i>Gustavus Adolphus</i> only wishes himself upon earth again, to
serve a captain under him: <i>Turenne</i> wants to be in <i>Italy</i>, and
<i>Wallesteen</i> assures him that prince <i>Eugene</i> of <i>Savoy</i> would have had
the same glorious success against him, as <i>Catinat</i> and <i>Villeroy</i>.
<i>Hannibal</i> ownâ€™d that his march over, or rather throâ€™ the <i>Alpes</i>, was
not so honourable an action as the princeâ€™s; and thoâ€™ arts and
experience may make a general, yet nature can only inform an <i>Eugene</i>.
Surly <i>Charon</i> had been so plaguâ€™d with the <i>French</i> from those parts,
that he has been forcâ€™d to leave whole shoals of them behind. Once they
crowded in so fast, as they almost overset the boat, and still as they
pressâ€™d forward, cryâ€™d <i>Vauban, Vauban</i>: But the old gentleman,
unwilling to hazzard himself, pushâ€™d a multitude of them back with his
sculls, and so put off&#8212;&#8212; However, this is not the business I designâ€™d
to mention; something more particular, and of more weighty consequence<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_125">{125}</a></span>
is the occasion of this letter. The real wits refusâ€™d to take notice of
prince <i>Arthur</i>, and king <i>Arthur</i>, who were walking hand in hand; some
shallow-pated versificators would resent the indignity put upon â€™em.
This was very disgusting to the <i>literati</i>, and it is inconceivable what
a horrid stench they made with uttering those verses. The more robust
spirits were almost choakâ€™d; you may then judge what condition the
delicate and nice stomachs of the men of wit were in; but while every
one was wishing for their cloaths of humanity again to be less sensible
of this execrable smell, a worthy <i>literati</i> came in from <i>London</i>, who
being informed of the occasion of that terrible inconveniency, repeated
a few commendatory verses, and immediately the air grew tolerable, and
the brimstone burnt serene. <i>Job</i> himself did confess, that had he been
in the flesh again, he was terribly afraid he should have murderâ€™d the
doctor: When a merry spirit standing at his elbow, said, it was no such
wonderful thing to have a sirreverence of a man be mine arse of a poet.
But <i>Charon</i> waits, I must conclude; and as conveniency serves, shall
inform you of what passes in those gloomy regions.</p>

<i>Society. By Capt.</i> <span class="smcap">Ayloff</span>.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE shatterâ€™d lawrels of the <i>Acherontic</i>-walks, owe not so much of
their misfortune to the shallowness of <i>Aganippe</i>, as to the ungenerous
procedure of the sons of <i>Helicon</i>. Either the hill of <i>Parnassus</i> is
fortifyâ€™d, and what with antient and modern wit, even you, gentlemen of
real parts, have none of you that applause, which in a thousand
occasions you have so justly merited. These melancholy reflections,
gentlemen, add a new thickness to the gloomy sulphur; and we cannot
enjoy a perfect quiet here, seeing there is so great and so dangerous a
misunderstanding between you on the other side of <i>Phlegethon</i>. Why
should there be so many pointed satires<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">{126}</a></span> against one another? Why mould
you shew the very blockheads themselves where you men of sense are not
quite such as you would pass upon the world for? Your invidious
criticisms only shew others where you are vulnerable, and give an
argument under your own hand against your own selves. There is a charity
in concealing faults; but to make them more obvious, has a double
ill-nature in it. Canâ€™t <i>Arthur</i> be a worthless poem, but a squadron of
poets must tell all the world so? Is there honour in rummaging a
dunghil, or telling the neighbours where there is one? The bee gathers
honey from every flower, â€™tis the beetles that delight in horse-dung. Is
it not much more preferable to make something ones self useful to
mankind, than only to shew wherein another is a coxcomb? Partisans in
wit never do well; they only lay the country waste; they gratify their
own private spleen, it may be, but they do not help the publick. Unite
your forces, gentlemen, against ignorance, that growing and powerful
enemy to you and us. Erect triumphal arches, to one another, and do not
enviously pull down what others are endeavouring to set up. Your mutual
quarrels have shaken the very foundation of wit and good humour. â€™Tis
the faction a man is of, determines what he is, not his learning and
parts; we cannot hear, gentlemen, of those intestine dissensions,
without a great concern and displeasure; and must take the liberty to
tell you, we apprehend the muses may shortly be reduced to the necessity
of shutting up the <i>Delphic</i> library, and write upon the doors, <i>Ruit
ipsa suis Roma viribus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Most worthy Kinsman and Benefactor</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Cannot but with the last degree of sorrow and anguish, inform you of
our present wretched condition; we have even tired our palms, and our
ribs at slappaty-pouch; and if it had not been for some gentlemen that
came from the coasts of <i>Italy</i>, I had almost forgot to handle my
sculls.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_127">{127}</a></span> There came a sneaking ghost here, some a day or two or three
ago, and he surprizâ€™d me with an account, (I may call it indeed a
terrible one) that you have had a maiden-sessions in your metropolis.
Was it then possible that <i>Newgate</i> should be without a rogue, or our
patron, the most worshipful Sir <i>Senseless Lovel</i> without any execution

veracity, by the thickest mud in <i>Acheron</i>, I swear, it is almost high
time that my boat was in mourning. What, he upon the bench and no man
hangâ€™d! Well, as assuredly as the blood of the horses will rise up in
judgment against our friend <i>Whitney</i>: this maiden-sessions shall rise
up in judgment against him. Such shoals as I have had from time to time,
meer sacrifices to his avarice or his malice, that unless his conscience
begins to fly in his face, I cannot comprehend what should occasion this
calm at the <i>Old-Baily</i>: For give me leave, dear cousin, to tell you,
that formerly he never savâ€™d any man for his money, but hangâ€™d another
in his room; trading was then pretty good, cousin, and there was a penny
to be got; but indeed, on your side it is very dull: nay, in <i>Flanders</i>
too, that fertile soil of blood and wounds, there has not one leg nor
one arm been brought us all this summer. Prithee be you <i>Charon</i>, and
let me be recorder, Iâ€™ll warrant you somewhat more to do.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE friendship that was between us formerly, equally obliges me to give
you a relation of my travels, and assures me of its welcome. Since my
peregrination from your factious regions, I have palled over various and
stupendious lakes; the roads are somewhat dark indeed, but the continued
exhalations of those amazing streams, make the travellers able to pass,
without running foul of one another. But â€™tis equally remarkable,
considering the length and darkness of the passage, that no person was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_128">{128}</a></span>
ever cast away on this river <i>Styx</i>, as I am credibly informâ€™d by the
ferryman, who has plyâ€™d here time out of mind. The dogs are pretty rife
in this country, and full as insufferable as ever they were among you: I
unfortunately forgot my lozenge-box, and have much impairâ€™d my lungs;
but they assure me, that these defluxions of rheums never kill. â€™Tis
prodigious, I protest, brother, to see how soon we learn the language,
or rather jargon of the place! how fast they come in from all parts of
the habitable world! And yet there is but one boat neither, and that no
bigger than above-bridge-wherry. At my coming ashoar, I was very
familiarly entertainâ€™d, and directed to an apartment in <i>Cocytus</i>: But
there was not one corner in all my passage, but I met some or other of
the wrangling fraternity of <i>Westminster</i>. I immediately suggested to
myself, that there might be (peradventure) a call of serjeants by his
majesty <i>Pluto</i>, who is sovereign of these gloomy regions; and who
besides his general residence here, has a most magnificent palace about
twenty miles off, at <i>Erebus</i>, on the side of the river <i>Phlegethon</i>. He
is one of a somewhat stern aspect, not easy of access; haughty in his
deportment, and barbarous to the last degree in his nature. There is no
sort of people he sets so much by, as those of our profession, thoâ€™ I
have not heard of any lawyer that had the honour to be in his cellar as
yet. Our old friend and fellow-toper judge <i>D</i>&#8212;&#8212; has very good
business here, upon my word, as likely to be preferrâ€™d, as vacancies
happen; for â€™tis always term-time in this kingdom throughout; and
besides, when he had his <i>quietus</i> sent him by the hands of Sir
<i>Thin-chops Mors</i>, you and I remember very well, that he had not the
best reputation for a man of parts. In the crowd of our pains-taking
brethren in the litigious school, I remarkâ€™d an innumerable quantity
that I was not quite an utter stranger to their faces, more
particularly, Mr. <i>Fil</i>&#8212;&#8212;, who, you know, did not want for sense, wit,
law, and good manners; and yet had so profound a genious, that he could
dispatch more business, and more wine in one nightâ€™s time, than <i>Bob.
Weeden</i> would have wishâ€™d for a patrimony: He very humanly accosted me,
and after a million of mutual civilities, he forced me to accept of my
mornings draught with him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_129">{129}</a></span> At night you know, I never refuse my bottle;
but for morning tippling, it was always my aversion, my abomination, my
hatred, my <i>noli me tangere</i>: Besides, the dismal prospect of the place,
gave me many shrewd suspicions, that those taverns were not furnishâ€™d
with the best accommodations, neither for manâ€™s meat, or horse meat
either; not that I had the vanity to take my coach with me neither, but
â€™tis to use an old proverb, that as yet I have not blotted out of my
memory. I had hardly disengagâ€™d myself from his civilities, but Mr.
<i>Nicholas Hard&#8212;</i> mighty gravely admonishâ€™d me of his former
familiarity, and with an air that was no ways contumelious, desirâ€™d to
know how <i>F</i>&#8212;&#8212; preachâ€™d, and <i>Burg</i>&#8212;&#8212; prayâ€™d; whether the grave Dr.
<i>W</i>&#8212;&#8212; continued his pious endeavours to convert the martyrâ€™d men of
his parish from the crying and heinous sin of <i>ebriety</i>; and yet at the
same instant almost, to contrive plausible ways and means of perverting
the modest and chaste propensities of their respective wives; and while
they would not quietly let their husbands be (by accident of good
company, or good wine) beasts, for but a few transitory nocturnal hours,
could yet drive to make them so beyond a possibility of redress; for
amongst friend, (brother) what collateral security can an honest,
prudent, wary, wise, good, upright, understanding, cautious, indulgent,
loving husband take, when that same godly man in black twirls his
primitive band-strings, and with his other hand has your dear spouse,
your help-mate, the wife of your bosom, the partner of your bed, by the
conscience, and somewhat else that begins with the same letter? â€™Twas
not want of leisure, (for alas! and alack) we have supernumerary hours
here; but pretended curiosity, (the last thing that dies with us but
hypocrisy) made me cut short the harangue, that this precise attorney
seemâ€™d by his demureness to expect from me: So, in short, I told him,
that his fellow-companions at six oâ€™ clock prayers had not forgot him;
and by what I could understand from those that were last with me, the
pew-keeper lamented his loss extreamly: nay, was inconsolable, for now
he was forced to use a pailful of water extraordinary once a week more
in the church than formerly; because he had gotten to such a perfection
in hy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_130">{130}</a></span>pocrisy, that what his knees did not rub clean, his eyes always
washâ€™d clean: but for his fatherâ€™s comfort, since he was got clear of
his <i>super-tartarian</i> concern, money was fallen, and his dearest darling
sin of all, extortion, was not a little under the hatches: but that he
might not be quite cast down, there was some seeds of it left still,
that would always keep old <i>Charon</i> well employâ€™d. I had hardly blessâ€™d
myself for having got rid of him, but a merry fellow (not to say
impertinent and sawcy to one of my capacity, volubility, and eloquence;
character, conduct, and reputation) pullâ€™d me by the coif; but as in
strange places â€™tis prudence to pass by small affronts and indignities,
because want of acquaintance is worse than want of knowledge; and the
law, you know brother, is not so expensive, as it is captious in the
main; not but that our industry does help it mightily to the one, if we
find it to be the other. Now who should this <i>Caitiff</i> be, but <i>Harry
C&#8212;&#8212;ff</i> the attorney; and all his mighty business was to know how his
laundress did; and if the maid got the better of her in the legacy he
gave her for her last consolations. Before I could recollect the secret
history of his amours, I was very courteously addressâ€™d by Mr. Common
Serjeant <i>C&#8212;&#8212;p</i>, who likewise in a florid stile, requested me to
inform him, if any of his modern bawds, that so punctually attended him,
had sufferâ€™d any prejudice by his absence: He was mightily in doubt of
their success, because experience had taught him, that <i>paupers</i> in
matters of law proceed but heavily; however, he could but wish them
well, because that thoâ€™ they were bad clients, he had always found them
good procurators&#8212;&#8212; My lady <i>Tysiphone</i> made a sumptuous entertainment,
and the countess of <i>Clotho</i> dancâ€™d smartly; the king of <i>Spain</i>
resented mightily that so many <i>English</i> were there, and had almost bred
a quarrel; but <i>Don Sebastian</i> king of <i>Portugal</i>, made up the matter,
by declining the <i>Spanish</i> faction, and said, it was highly unjust that
the <i>English</i> should be male-treated in their universal interest,
because he was a fool, and the cardinal that made his will a knave, and
the king of <i>France</i> a tyrant. But the catastrophe of this fit of the
spleen of the supercilious <i>Spaniard</i> was comical enough; for in the
crowd that was come together upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_131">{131}</a></span> the notice of his heart-burning, who
should stumble upon one another but <i>Godfrey Wood</i>&#8212;&#8212; the attorney, who
you may remember (brother) was committed for saying to a certain lord
chancellor, that he was his first maker; thoâ€™ the truth of the matter
was, their intimacy at play made him presume to beg the small favour of
his lordship, to pass an unjust decree in favour of his client. Well,
Sir, said the attorney to his lordship, now you are without your mace, I
must tell you, that had not you invited me to supper the same day you
sent me to the <i>Fleet</i>, I should have taken the freedom to have let you
known, that in this kingâ€™s dominions we are all equal. I left â€™em hard
at all-fours for a quart of <i>Acheron</i>, where they bite their nails like
mad, and divert others with their passion and concern&#8212;&#8212; But the
postillion is mounting, and I must defer the rest of my adventurers to
the next opportunity.</p>

Coffee-House in</i> Covent-Garden. <i>By Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Tho. Brown</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">U</span>NLESS my memory fails me since my coming into these subterranean
dominions, â€™twas much about this time last year, that I did myself the
honour to write to you: perhaps you expected a frequenter commerce from
me; and indeed, I should have been very proud to have maintained it on
my side, since nothing so much relieves me in these gloomy regions, as
to reflect on the many pleasant moments I have formerly passâ€™d in
<i>Covent-Garden</i>; but, alas! gentlemen, not to mention the great
difficulty of keeping such a correspondence, our lower world is nothing
near so fruitful in news as yours; one single sheet of paper will almost
contain the occurrences of a whole year; and were it not for the
numerous crowds of <i>Spaniards</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Poles</i>, <i>Germans</i>, &amp;c. that
daily arrive here, and entertain us with the transactions of <i>Europe</i>,
hell would be as melancholy a place as <i>Westminster-Hall</i> in the long
vacation; and the generality of people among us would have as little to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_133">{133}</a></span>
employ their idle hours, as a lord-treasurer in <i>Scotland</i>, or a barber
in <i>Muscovy</i>. Besides, to speak more particularly, as to myself, that
everlasting hurry and tide of business, wherein I hive been overwhelmâ€™d
ever since I honourâ€™d myself with the title of <i>High-German</i> doctor and
astrologer, does so entirely challenge all my time, that if you will
take my word, (and I hope you donâ€™t suspect a person of my veracity) I
am forcâ€™d, at this present writing, to deny myself to all my patients,
thoâ€™ there are at least some half a score coaches with coronets waiting
now at my door, that I might receive no interruption from any visitants,
while I was dispatching this epistle to you.</p>

<p>My last, gentlemen, as you may easily remember, if you have not buried
such a trifle in oblivion, concluded with my taking a large house here
in <i>Brandinopolis</i>, and setting up for a physician and fortune-teller: I
shall now proceed to acquaint you, by what laudable artifices and
stratagems I advanced myself into that mighty reputation; in which, to
the admiration of this populous town, I at present flourish; what
notable cures I have performed, what sort of customers chiefly resort to
me; and lastly, To give you a short account of the most memorable
occurrences that have lately happenâ€™d in these parts.</p>

<p>By the direction of my worthy friend, Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, who liberally
supplyâ€™d me with money to carry on this affair, I took a spacious house
in the great <i>Piazza</i> here, then empty by the death of one of the most
eminent physicians of this famous city. This you must own to me,
gentlemen, was as favourable a step at my first setting out, as a man
could possibly wish; for you cannot be ignorant how many sorry brothers
of the faculty in <i>London</i> keep their coaches, and wriggle themselves
into business, with no other merit to recommend them, than that of
dwelling in the same house where a celebrated doctor lived before them.
For this reason, I suppose, it was, (if you can pardon so short a
digression) that the popes came to monopolize the ecclesiastical
practice of the western world to themselves, by succeeding so great a
bishop as St. <i>Peter</i>. So much is the world governâ€™d by appearances, and
so apt to be cheated, as if knowledge and learning were bequeathâ€™d to
one house or place; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_134">{134}</a></span> like a piece of common furniture, went to the
next inhabiter.</p>

<p>But to dismiss this speculation, which perhaps may seem somewhat odd,
from a man of my merry character; having provided my house with every
thing convenient, adornâ€™d my hall with the pictures of <i>Galen</i>,
<i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Albumazar</i>, and <i>Paracelsus</i>; crammâ€™d my library with a
vast collection of books, in all arts and languages, (thoâ€™ under the
rose be it spoken, my worthy friends, your humble servant does not
understand a syllable of them) furnishâ€™d it with a pair of globes
curiously painted, with the <i>exuviÃ¦</i> of two or three <i>East-India</i>
animals, a rattlesnake and a crocodile; and set up a fine elaboratory in
my court-yard. In short, after having taken care to set off my hall,
parlour and study, with all those noble decorations that serve to amuse
the multitude, and create strange ideas in them, I orderâ€™d a spacious
stage to be erected before my own habitation, got my bills ready
printed, together with a long catalogue of the cures performâ€™d by me,
during the time of my practising physick in your upper world; and then I
broke out with a greater expectation and <i>eclat</i> than any doctor before
me was ever known to do.</p>

<p>Three or four weeks before I made my appearance in publick, which, as I
told you before, I intended to make with all the magnificence
imaginable, Mr. <i>Nokes</i> and I, in conjunction with my brother comedian,
<i>Tony Lee</i>, laid our heads together, how to sham me upon the town for a
<i>virtuoso</i>, a miracle-monger, and what not. To favour this design, we
sent for three or four topping apothecaries to the tavern, gave them a
noble collation, and when half a dozen bumpers of wine had got us a free
admission into their hearts, we fairly let them into the secret; which
was, That they were to trumpet me up in all coffee-houses and places of
publick resort in town, for the ablest physician that ever came into
these parts; and as one kindness justly challenges another, I for my
part was to write bills as tall as the monument, and charge them with
the most costly medicines, thoâ€™ they signifyâ€™d nothing at all to the
patientâ€™s recovery. In short, the bargain was immediately struck up
between us; and those worthy gentlemen, Iâ€™ll say that for them, have not
been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_135">{135}</a></span> wanting to proclaim my extraordinary merits to all their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>This was not all; but Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, who was resolvâ€™d at any rate to
introduce me into business, coming into one of the best frequented
chocolate-houses near the court, (for <i>Brandinopolis</i>, you must know, is
a perfect transcript of your wicked city) on a sudden pretends to be
troubled with intolerable gripings of the guts; and acted his part so
dextrously, that all the company pitied him, and thought he would expire
upon the spot. Immediately two or three doctors were sent for; who,
after a tedious consultation, at last pitchâ€™d upon a never-failing
remedy, as they were pleasâ€™d to call it; which accordingly they applyâ€™d,
but without the desired effect. As his pains still continued upon him,
<i>What</i>, says he, <i>must I die here for want of help? And is there never
another physician to be had for love nor money?</i> With that a certain
gentleman, that was posted there for that purpose, Sir, says he, thereâ€™s
a <i>German</i> doctor lately come here, but for my part, I dare not
recommend him to you, for heâ€™s a perfect stranger to us, and no body
knows him. <i>Oh, send for him, send for him</i>, cries Mr. <i>Nokes</i>, <i>these</i>
German <i>doctors are the finest fellows in the world; who can tell but he
may give me present ease?</i> Upon this, a messenger was hurried to me with
all expedition: I told him I would come so soon as I had dispatchâ€™d a
patient or two; and in a quarter of an hour came thundering to the door
in my chariot, and all the way pored upon a little book I carried in my
hands; thoâ€™ I must frankly own to you, that a coach is as uncomfortable
a place to read, as to consummate in; but, gentlemen, â€™tis with us here,
as in your world, nothing is to be done without policy and trick:
marching into the room with that gravity and solemn countenance, which
we physicians know so well to put on upon these occasions, and brushing
throâ€™ a numerous crowd of spectators, who stood there, expecting to see
what would be the result of this affair, I found Mr. <i>Nokes</i> in such
terrible agonies, that any man would have swore he could not out-live
another minute. I felt his pulse, and told him, that by the
irregularities of his systole, and unequal vibration of his diastole, I
knew as well what ailâ€™d him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_136">{136}</a></span> as if I had seen him taken to pieces like
a watch; and plucking a small chrystal bottle out of my pocket, Sir,
says I to him, take some half a score drops of this <i>Anodyne Elixir</i>,
and Iâ€™ll engage all I am worth in the world, it will immediately relieve
you. But, under favour, Sir, to give you some short account of it before
you take it, you must understand, Sir, â€™tis composed of two costly and
sovereign ingredients, which no man, besides myself, dares pretend to.
The first, Sir, is the celebrated balsam of <i>Chili</i>, (thoâ€™ by the by,
the devil a jot of balsam, comes from that <i>Pagan</i> place) and the
second, Sir, that most excellent cephalick, which the mongrelian
physicians call, the <i>electrum</i> of <i>Samogitia</i>, gatherâ€™d at certain
seasons, Sir, upon the shore of the <i>Deucalidonian</i> ocean, by the
<i>Ciracassian</i> fishermen. Mr. <i>Nokes</i> listned to this edifying discourse
with wonderful attention, then followed my direction; and before you
could count twenty, got upon his legs, took a few turns about the room,
cut a caper a yard high, and kindly embracing me, doctor, says he, I am
more obliged to you, than words are able to express; you have delivered
me from the most intolerable pains that ever poor wretch groanâ€™d under:
and then presenting me with a purse of guineas, I hope youâ€™ll be pleasâ€™d
to accept of this small trifle, till I am in a capacity of making you a
better acknowledgment: However, to express in some measure my gratitude
to yourself, as likewise to shew my regard for the publick welfare, I
will take care to get the extraordinary cure advertised in the
<i>Gazette</i>, and other publick papers. I told him he had more than paid me
for so inconsiderable a a matter, adding, That I was at his service
whenever he or any of his friends would do me the honour to send for me;
and so took my leave of him.</p>

<p>This miraculous operation (for so they were pleased to christen it)
occasionâ€™d a great deal of talk in the town, very much to my advantage;
but what happenâ€™d three days after, perfectly confirmâ€™d all sorts of
people, that I was a <i>Non-pareil</i> in my profession, and out-went all
that ever pretended to physick before me.</p>

<p><i>Tony Lee</i>, who, as I told you in my last, keeps a conventicle in this
infernal world, and was engagâ€™d as well as my brother <i>Nokes</i> in the
confederacy to serve me, took<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_137">{137}</a></span> occasion to be surprisâ€™d with apoplectick
fits in the beginning of his sermon; he had hardly split and divided his
text, according to the usual forms, but his eyes rowlâ€™d in his head,
every muscle in his face was distorted; he foamâ€™d at mouth, fumbled with
the cushion, over-set the hour-glass, droppâ€™d his notes and bible upon
the clerkâ€™s head, and at last down he sunk as flat as a flounder to the
bottom of the pulpit. â€™Tis impossible to describe to you what a strange
consternation the auditory were in at this calamitous disaster that had
befallen their minister: the men stared at one another, as they had been
all bewitchâ€™d; and the women set up such a hideous screaming and
roaring, that I question whether they would have done so much if a
regiment of dragoons had broke into the room to ravish them. The duchess
of <i>Mazarine</i> chafed his temples; Mother <i>Stratford</i> (of pious memory)
luggâ€™d a brandy-bottle out of her pocket, and rubbâ€™d his nostrils; but
still poor <i>Tony</i> continuâ€™d senseless, and without the least motion.
When they found all these means ineffectual, at last the whole
congregation unanimously resolvâ€™d to send for me; who, according as it
had been agreed before-hand between us, soon brought my holy <i>Levite</i> to
his senses again, by applying a few drops of my aforesaid <i>Elixir</i> to
his temples. Honest <i>Tony</i> was no sooner recoverâ€™d, but I had the thanks
of the whole assembly; and a reverend elder in a venerable band, that
reachâ€™d from shoulder to shoulder, offerâ€™d me a handsome gratuity for my
pains; but I refusâ€™d it, telling him, I lookâ€™d upon myself sufficiently
rewarded, since I had been the happy (thoâ€™ unworthy) instrument in the
hand of providence (and then I turnâ€™d up the whites of my eyes most
religiously towards Heaven) to save the life of so precious and powerful
a divine.</p>

<p>This pair of miraculous cures flew throâ€™ every street, alley, and corner
of the town, like a train of gun-powder, with more expedition and
improvements, than scandal used, in my time, to walk about <i>Whitehall</i>;
and as it usually happens, in these cases, lost nothing in the relation.
The godly party much magnifyâ€™d me for refusing the unrighteous <i>mammon</i>
when it was offerâ€™d me; my two trusty apothecaries talkâ€™d of nothing but
the prodi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">{138}</a></span>gies of seignior <i>Hanesio</i>; but my surest cards, the midwives
and nurses, when the sack-posset and brandy began to operate in their
noddles, thought they could never say enough in my commendation.</p>

<p>Thus, gentlemen, I had abundantly securâ€™d to myself the reputation of a
great physician; and nothing now remainâ€™d, but to make the world believe
I was personally acquainted with every star in the firmament, could
extort what confessions I pleasâ€™d out of the planets; and was no less
skillâ€™d in astrology than in medicine. My never failing friend <i>Tony</i>,
was once more pleasâ€™d to give me a lift upon this occasion. As the
dissenting ministers (you know) have the privilege to go into the
bed-chambers and closets of the ladies that resort to their meetings,
without the least offence or scandal, <i>Tony</i> spyâ€™d his opportunity, when
the room was clear, rubbâ€™d off with a gold watch, and some lockets of
the duchess of <i>Mazarine</i>â€™s. The things were immediately missing, but
who durst suspect a person of the pious Mr. <i>Lee</i>â€™s character and
function? In short, every servant in the family was threatened with the
rack; and the whole house, trunks, coffers, boxes, and all examinâ€™d,
from the garret down to the cellar. The poor duchess took the loss of
her watch and lockets mightily to heart, kept her bed upon it for a
fortnight; but at last was perswaded to make her application to my
worship. I told her, <i>sur le champ</i>, that her things were safe, that the
party who made bold with them, being troubled with compunctions of
conscience, had not sold but hid them under such a tree, which I
described to her in queen <i>Proserpine</i>â€™s park; and that if she went
thither next morning by break of day, she would find my words true.
Accordingly as I predicted, it happened to a tittle (for I had taken
care to lodge them there the night before). And now who was the
universal subject of peopleâ€™s discourse, but the famous seignior
<i>Giusippe</i>.</p>

<p>So that when the long expected day came, on which I was to make my
publick appearance, the streets, windows and balconies, were so crammâ€™d
with spectators of all sorts, that as often as I think onâ€™t, I pity my
poor lord-mayor and aldermen with all my heart, that their
<i>Cheapside</i>-show shouâ€™d fall so infinitely short of mine. <i>Tom
Shadwell</i>, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_139">{139}</a></span> still keeps up his musical talent in these gloomy
territories, began the entertainment with thrumming upon an old broken
theorbo, and merry Sir <i>John Falstaff</i> sung to him, and afterwards both
of them walkâ€™d upon the slack rope, in a pair of jack-boots, to the
admiration of all the beholders. After the mob had been diverted for
some time with entertainments of this nature, and, particularly, by some
legerdemain tricks of <i>Appollonius TyanÃ¦us</i>, my conjurer, being attended
by Dr. <i>Connor</i>, my toad-eater in ordinary, Mr. <i>Lobb</i>, the late
presbyterian parson, my corn-cutter; Sir <i>Patient Ward</i>, my
merry-andrew, and the famous <i>Mithridates</i> king of <i>Pontus</i>, my orator,
I mounted the stage, and bowing on each side me, paid my respects to the
noble company, in a most ceremonious manner. I was apparellâ€™d in a black
velvet coat, trimmâ€™d with large gold loops of the newest fashion, and
buttons as big as ostrichâ€™s eggs; my muff was at least an ell long. I
traversâ€™d my stage some half a score times, then cocking my beaver, and
holding up my cane close to my nose after the manner of us sons of
<i>Galen</i>, I haranguâ€™d them as follows: In the first place I told them,
That it was not without the utmost regret, that I saw so many quacks and
nauseous pretenders to the faculty, daily impose upon the publick. That
neither ambition, self-interest, or the like sordid motive, had tempted
me to expose myself thus upon the theatre of the world; and that nothing
but a generous zeal to rescue medicine out of the hands of a pack of
rascals, that were a dishonour to it, and the particular respect I bore
to the inhabitants of the most renownâ€™d city of <i>Brandinopolis</i>; who for
their good breeding and civility to strangers, were not to be equallâ€™d
in any of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s dominions, had prevailâ€™d over my natural modesty,
and drawn me out of my beloved obscurity; that lastly, I requested a
favourable construction upon this publick way of practice, which some
impudent emperics (whom I scorn to mention) had renderâ€™d scandalous; and
as I was a graduate in several universities, would have certainly
declinâ€™d, but that my regard for the <i>salus populi</i> superseded all those
scruples; and made me rather hazard the loss of my reputation with some
censorious persons, than lose any opportunity of exerting my utmost
abilities for the benefit of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>When this harangue was over, I withdrew, and left the rest of the
ceremony to be performâ€™d by my orator <i>Mithridates</i>, who descanted a
long while upon my great experience and skill, my travels, and great
adventures in foreign countries; the testimonials, certificates, medals,
and the like favours, I had receivâ€™d from most of the crownâ€™d heads and
princes in the universe. And when this was over, orderâ€™d <i>Matt.
Gilliflower</i> and <i>Dick Bently</i>, two of my footmen to disperse printed
copies of my bill among the people, together with the catalogue of the
cures by me formerly performâ€™d in your upper hemisphere; both which
papers, because they contain something singular in them, and are written
above the common strain, I have given my self the trouble to transcribe.</p>

<p class="nind">circulation, reforms the digestion of the chylon, fortifies the
opthalmic nerves, clears the officina intelligentiÃ¦, corrects the
exorbitancy of the spleen, mundifies the hypogastrium, comforts the
sphincter, and is an excellent remedy against the prosopochlorosis,
or green-sickness, sterility, and all obstructions whatever. They
operate seven several ways in, order, as nature herself requires;
for they scorn to be confinâ€™d to any particular way of operation,
<i>viz.</i> hypnotically; by throwing the party into a gentle slumber;
hydrotically by their operitive faculty, in opening the interstitia
pororum; carthartically, by cleansing the bowels of all crudities
and tartarous mucilage, with which they abound; proppysmatically,
by forcing the wind downward; hydragogically, by exciting urine;
pneumatically, by exhilerating the spirits; and lastly,
synecdochically, by corroborating the whole <i>oeconomia animalis</i>.
They are twenty or more in every tin-box, sealed with my coat of
arms, which are, <i>Three clyster pipes erect</i> gules, <i>in a field
argent</i>; my crest, <i>a bloody hand out of a mortar, emergent</i>; and
my supporters, <i>a Chymist and an Apothecary</i>. This <i>Tinctura
Solaris</i>, or most noble off-spring of <i>Hyperion</i>â€™s golden
influence, wipes off abstersively all those tenacious,
conglomerated, sedimental sordes, that adhere to the Å“sophagus and
viscera, extinguishes all supernatural ferments and ebullitions;
and, in fine, annihilates all the nosotrophical or morbific ideas
of the whole corporeal <i>compages</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, My <i>Panagion Outacousticon</i>, or auricular restorative:
were it possible to show me a man so deaf, that if a demiculverin
were to be let off under his ear, he could not hear the report, yet
these infallible drops (first invented by the two famous
physician-brothers, St. <i>Cosmus</i>, and St. <i>Damian</i>, callâ€™d the
<i>Anargyri</i> in the ancient <i>Greek</i> menologies; and some forty years
ago, communicated to me by <i>Anastasio Logotheti</i>, a <i>Greek</i> collier
at <i>Adrianople</i>, when I was invited into those parts to cure sultan
<i>Mahomet</i> IV. of an elephantiasis in his diaphragm) would recover
his auditive faculty, and make him hear as smartly as an old
fumbling priest, when a young wench gives him account of her lost
maiden-head at the confessional.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, My <i>Anodyne Spirit</i>, excellent to ease pain, when taken
inwardly, and applied outwardly, excellent for any lameness,
shrinking or contraction of the nerves; for eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">{142}</a></span> deafness, pain
and noise in the ears; and all odontalgic, as well as podagrical
inflammations.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, My <i>Antidotus Antivenerealis</i>; which effectually cures
all gonorrheas, carnosities in the delinquent part, tumours,
phymosis, paraphymosis, christalline priapisms, hemorrhoids,
cantillamata, ragades, bubos, imposthumations, carbuncles,
genicular nodes, and the like, without either baths or stoves; as
also without mercury so often destructive to the poor patient, with
that privacy, that the nearest relation shall not perceive it.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>, My <i>Pectoral Lozenges</i>, or <i>Balsam</i> of <i>Balsams</i>, which
effectually carries off all windy and tedious coughs, spitting of
blood, wheezing in the larynx and ptyalismus, let it be never so
inveterate.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly</i>, and <i>lastly</i>, My <i>Pulvis Vermifugus</i>, or <i>Antivermatic
Powder</i> brings up the rear, so famous for killing and bringing away
all sorts of worms incident to human bodies breaking their
complicated knots in the <i>duodenum</i>, and dissolving the phlegmatick
crudities that produce those anthropophagous vermin. It has brought
away, by urine, worms as long as the may-pole in the <i>Strand</i>, when
it flourishâ€™d in its primitive prolixity, thoâ€™, I confess, not
altogether so thick. In short, â€™tis a specifick catholicon for the
cholick, expels winds by eructation, or otherwise; accelerates
digestion, and creates an appetite to a miracle.</p>

<p>I dexterously couch the cataract or suffusion, extirpate wens of
the greatest magnitude, close up hair-lips, whether treble or
quadruple; cure the polipus upon the nose, and all scrophulous
tumours, cancers in the breast, <i>Noli me tangeri</i>â€™s, St.
<i>Anthony</i>â€™s fire, by my new invented <i>unguentum Antipyreticum</i>,
excrescences, or superfluous flesh in the mouth of the bladder or
womb; likewise I take the stone from women or maids without
cutting.</p>

<p>I have steel trusses, and instruments of a new invention, together
with never-failing medicines and methods to cure ruptures, and knit
the peritonÃ¦um. And here I cannot forbear to communicate an useful
piece of knowledge to the world, which is, that with the learned
<i>Villipandus</i>, in his excellent treatise, <i>de congrubilitate
materiÃ¦ primÃ¦ cum confessione Augustana</i>, I take a rupture to be a
relaxation of the natural cavities, at the bottom of the cremaster
muscles. But this, <i>en passant</i>, I forge all<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_143">{143}</a></span> my self; nay my very
machines for safe and easy drawing teeth and obscure stumps. Mrs.
<i>Littlehand</i>, midwife to the princess of <i>Phlegethon</i>, can
sufficiently inform the women of my helps, and what I do for the
disruption of the fundament and uterus, and other strange
infirmities of the matrix, occasioned by the bearing of children,
violent coughing, heavy work, <i>&amp;c.</i> which I challenge any person in
the <i>Acherontic</i> dominions to perform, but my self.</p>

<p>If any woman be unwilling to speak to me, they may have the
conveniency of speaking to my wife, who is expert in all feminine
distempers. She has an excellent cosmetick water to carry off
freckles, sun-burn, or pimples; and a curious red pomatum to plump
and colour the lips. She can make red hair as white as a lilly; she
shapes the eyebrows to a miracle; makes low foreheads as high as
you please, has a never failing remedy for offensive breaths, a
famous essence to correct the ill scent of the arm-pits, a rich
water that makes the hair curl, a most delicate paste to smooth and
whiten the hands; also,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Those who are not able to come to me, let them send their urine,
especially that made after midnight, and on sight of it, I will
tell them what their distemper is, and whether curable or no. Nay,
let a man be in never so perfect health of body, his constitution
never so vigorous and athletical, if he shews me his water, I can
as infallibly predict what distemper will first attack him, though
perhaps it will be thirty or forty years hence, as an astronomer,
by the rules of his science, can foretel solar or lunar eclipses
the year before they happen. I have predicted miraculous things by
the pulse, far above any philosopher: by it, I not only discover
the circumstances of the body; but if the party be a woman, I can
foretel how many husbands and children she shall have; if a
tradesman whether his wife will fortify his forehead with horns;
and so of the rest. This is not all, but I will engage to tell any
serious persons what their business is on every radical figure,
before they speak one word; what has already hap<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_144">{144}</a></span>penâ€™d to them from
their very infancy down to the individual hour of their consulting
me, what their present circumstances are, what will happen to them
hereafter; in what part of the body they have moles; what colour
and magnitude they are of; and lastly, how profited, that is,
whether they calminate equinoctially or horizontally upon the
<i>Mesogastrium</i>; from which place alone, and no other, as the
profound <i>Trismegistus</i> has observâ€™d before me, in his elaborate
treatise <i>de erroribus Styli Gregoriani</i>, all solid conjectures are
to be formed.</p>

<p>I have likewise attained to the green, golden and black dragon,
known to none but magicians and hermatic philosophers; I tell the
meaning of all magical panticles, sigils, charms and lameness, and
have a glass, and help to further marriage; and what is more, by my
learning and great travels, I have obtained the true and perfect
seed and blossom of the female fern; and infinitely improvâ€™d that
great traveller major <i>John Coke</i>â€™s famous necklaces for breeding
of teeth. The spring being already advancâ€™d, which is the properest
season for preventing new, and renewing old distempers, neglect not
this opportunity&#8212;&#8212;</p>

the afternoon till nine at night, every day in the week, except on

<p>This, gentlemen, is an exact copy of my bill, which has been carefully
distributed all over this populous city, pasted upon the chief gates and
churches; and since dispersed by two running messengers, <i>Theophrastus
Paracelsus</i> and <i>Cornelius Agrippa</i>, all over king <i>Pluto</i>â€™s dominions.
I forgot to tell you, that finding it absolutely necessary to take me a
wife, (the women in certain cases that shall be nameless, being
unwilling to consult any but those of their own sex) I was advised by
some friends to make my applications to the famous <i>Cleopatra</i> queen of
<i>Egypt</i>, who being a person of great experience, and notably well
skillâ€™d in the <i>Arcana</i>â€™s of nature, would in all probability make me an
admirable spouse. In short, after half a dozen meetings, rather for form
sake than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_145">{145}</a></span> thing else, the bargain was struck, and a match concluded
between her <i>Alexandrian</i> majesty and myself; cardinal <i>Wolsey</i>, who is
now curate of a small village, to the tune of four marks <i>per annum</i>,
and the magnificent perquisites of a bear and fiddle, performâ€™d the holy
ceremony: <i>Amphion</i> of <i>Thebes</i> diverted us at dinner with his crowd,
and all the while <i>Molinos</i>, the quietist, danced a <i>Lancashire</i> jigg.
Sir <i>Thomas Pilkington</i>, who, as I told you in my last, is become a most
furious rhime-tagger or versificator, composed the <i>epithilamium</i>; and
<i>Sardanapalus</i>, <i>Caligula</i>, <i>Nero</i>, <i>Heliogabalus</i>, and pope <i>Alexander</i>
VII. were pleasâ€™d to throw the stocking. Her majesty, to do her a piece
of common justice, proves a most dutiful and laborious wife, spreads all
my plaisters, makes all my unguents, distills all my waters, and pleases
my customers beyond expression.</p>

<p>Thus, gentlemen, you see my bill, by which you may guess whether I donâ€™t
infinitely surpass those empty pretending quacks of your world, who
confine their narrow talent to one distemper, which they cure but by one
remedy; whereas all diseases are alike to me, and I have a hundred
several ways to extirpate them. I shall now trespass so far upon your
patience, as to present you with the catalogue of my cures, which being
somewhat singular, and out of the way, I have the vanity to believe will
not be unwelcome to you&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">B</span>Ecause I am so much a person of honour and integrity, that even in
this lower world I would not forfeit my reputation, I desire my
incredulous adversaries (of which number, being a stranger to this
place, I presume I have but too many) to get if they can to the
upper re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">{146}</a></span>gions, and satisfy themselves of the truth of my admirable
performances. To begin then with those of quality.</p>

<p>Pope <i>Innocent</i> the eleventh was so strangely over run with a
complication of <i>Jansenism</i>, <i>Quietism</i>, and <i>Lutheranism</i>, that
not only his nephew, Don <i>Livio Odeschalchi</i>, but the whole sacred
consistory despaired of his recovery; I so mundifyâ€™d his
intellectuals with my catholick essence of <i>Hellebore</i>, that he
continued <i>rectus in cerebro</i> many years after; and if the <i>French</i>
ambassador, by making such a hubbub about his quarters, occasionâ€™d
old infallibility to relapse, <i>LoÃ¼is le Grand</i> must answer for it,
and not signior <i>Giusippe</i>.</p>

<p>I cured the late <i>Sophy</i> of <i>Persia</i>, <i>Shaw Solyman</i> by name, of a
<i>Febris Tumulenta</i>, so that he could digest the exactions and blood
of a whole province, hold his hand as steady as <i>Harry Killegrew</i>
after a quart of surfeit water in a morning; and if he dyâ€™d
presently after, let his eunuchs and whores look to that, if one
with their politicks, and the other with their tails, spoilâ€™d the
operation of my <i>Elixir magnum stomachicum</i>.</p>

<p>I cured <i>Aureng-Zebe</i>, the old mogul, of an <i>epilepsia fanatica</i>,
with which he was afflicted to that degree, that patents were
dispatchâ€™d, and persons named to go ambassadors extraordinary to
<i>William Pen</i>, <i>George Whitehead</i>, <i>William Mede</i>; the
<i>Philadelphians</i>, <i>Cameronians</i>, <i>Jesuits</i>, and <i>Jacobian
Whiskerites</i>, for a communication of diseases and remedies; but by
my cephalick snuff and tincture, I made him as clear headed a rake
as ever got drunk with classics at the university, or expounded
<i>Horace</i> in <i>Will</i>â€™s coffee-house; and messengers were sent throâ€™
all his empire to get him <i>Dutry</i>, <i>Bung</i>, <i>Satyrion</i>,
<i>Cantharides</i>, <i>Whores</i>, and <i>Schyraz wine</i>; and if he has since
fallen down to his <i>Alcoran</i> and the flat effects of ninety seven
years of age, blame his damnâ€™d courtiers and not me, that instead
of nicking the nice operation of the medicine, let in books and
priests, to debauch his understanding.</p>

<p>I cured the <i>Mahometan</i> predestinarian <i>Sultan</i> of the great <i>East
India</i> island <i>Borneo</i>, of want of blood, by counselling him to
follow his inclinations and bathe in it, that he might restore
himself by spight and percolation; but vexations from his <i>Divan</i>,
the neighbour emperor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_147">{147}</a></span> <i>China</i>, a saucy young jackanapes, and a
sorrel hairâ€™d female gave him such jolts, that quite spoilâ€™d the
continuance of the noblest cure in the world.</p>

<p><i>Peter Alexowitz</i>, present czar of <i>Muscovy</i>, fell ill of a
<i>Calenture</i> in <i>London</i>, occasionâ€™d by putting too great a quantity
of gun-powder into his usquebaugh, and pepper into his brandy; all
the topping doctors of the town were sent for, and applyâ€™d their
<i>Cortex</i> and <i>Opium</i> to no purpose. What should I do in this pinch,
but orderâ€™d a hole to be made in the <i>Thames</i> for him, as they do
for the ducks in St. <i>Jamesâ€™s-Park</i>, it being then an excessive
frost, sousâ€™d him over head and ears morning and night, and by this
noble experiment not only recovered him, but likewise gave a hint
to the setting up of a cold-bath near Sir <i>John Oldcastle</i>â€™s which
has done such miracles since.</p>

<p>I cured a noble peer, aged sixty seven, of a perpetual priapism, so
that now his pimping valets, and footmen, his bawds, spirit of
<i>Clary</i>, and a maidenhead of fourteen can hardly raise him, who
before was scarce to be trusted with his own family; nay, his own
wife: and now heâ€™s as continent and virtuous a statesman as ever
linâ€™d his inward letchery with outward gravity.</p>

<p>A noble peeress, that lives not full a hundred miles from St.
<i>James</i>â€™s square, in the sixty sixth year of her age, was seizâ€™d
with a <i>furor uterinus</i>; by plying her ladyship with a few drops of
my <i>Antepyretical Essence</i>, extracted from a certain vegetable
gathered under the artic pole, and known to no body but myself, I
perfectly allayâ€™d this preternatural ferment; and now she lies at
quiet, thoâ€™ both her hands are untyâ€™d as a new swaddled babe, and
handles no rascals but <i>Pam</i>, and his gay fellows of the cards.</p>

<p><i>Honoraria Frail</i>, eldest daughter to my old lady <i>Frail</i> of
<i>Red-Lyon-Square</i>, by too prodigally distributing <i>les dernieres
feveurs</i> to her motherâ€™s sandy pated coachman and pages, had so
strangely dilated the gates <i>du citadel dâ€™amour</i>, that one might
have marched a regiment of dragoons throâ€™ them. Her mother, who was
in the greatest perplexities imaginable upon the score of this
disaster, sent to consult me: With half a dozen drops of my <i>Aqua
Styptica</i>, <i>Hymenealis</i>, I so contracted all the avenues of the
aforesaid citadel, that the <i>Yorkshire</i> knight that marryâ€™d her,
spent above a hundred small-shot against the walls, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_148">{148}</a></span> bombarded
the fortress a full fortnight before he couâ€™d enter it; and now
they are the happiest couple within the bills of mortality.</p>

<p>I renewed the youth from the girdle downwards of madam <i>de
Maintenon</i>, so that she afforded all the delights imaginable, to
her old grand lover in imagination, and to the younger bigots and
herself in reality: while her face still remainâ€™d as great an
object of mortification as her beads, deathâ€™s-head, and discipline;
and this noble cure still remains to be viewâ€™d by all the world.</p>

<p><i>Harry Higden</i> of the <i>Temple</i>, counsellor, was so miserably
troubled with the long vacation disease, or the <i>defectus crumenÃ¦</i>,
that the sage benchers of the house threatned to padlock his
chamber door for non-payment of rent. He asked my advice in this
exigence: I, who knew the full strength of his furniture, which
consisted of a rug, two blankets, a joint-stool, and a
tin-candlestick, that served him for a piss-pot when reversâ€™d,
counselled him to take his door off the hinges, and lock it up in
his study. He followed my advice, and by that means escaped the
abovementionâ€™d ostracism of the padlock.</p>

<p><i>Margaret Cheatly</i>, bawd, match-maker, and mid-wife of
<i>Bloomsbury</i>, by immoderate drinking of strong-waters, had got a
nose so termagantly rubicund, that she out-blazed the comet: my
cosmetic <i>Florentine-unguent</i>, absolutely reformâ€™d this
inflammation, and now she looks as soberly as a dissenting
ministerâ€™s goggle-eyâ€™d convenience.</p>

<p><i>Jerry Scandal</i>, whale and ghost printer in <i>White-Friers</i>, had
plagued the town above ten years with apparitions, murders,
catechisms, and the like stuff; by showing him the phiz of terrible
<i>Robin</i> in my green magic-glass, I so effectually frighted him,
that he has since demolishâ€™d all his letters, dismissed his
hawkers, flung up his business, and instead of news, cries
flounders and red-herrings about the streets.</p>

<p><i>Joachim Hazard</i>, of <i>Cripplegate</i> parish in <i>White-cross-street</i>,
almost at the farther end near <i>Old-street</i>, turning in at the sign
of the <i>White Crow</i> in <i>Goat-alley</i>, strait forward, down
three-steps at the sign of the <i>Globe</i>, was so be-devilâ€™d with the
spirit of lying, that he out-did two hard mouthâ€™d evidences in
their own profession, and could not open his mouth without
romancing; I made him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_149">{149}</a></span> snuff up some half a score drops of my
<i>Elixir Alethinum</i>, and now he has left off fortune-telling and
astrology, and is returnâ€™d to his primitive trade of weaving.</p>

<p><i>Farmer Frizzle-pate</i>, of <i>Bullington</i>, near <i>Andover</i>, had been
blind thirty five years and upwards; my <i>Ophthalmick</i> drops
restorâ€™d him to his sight in a minute, and now he can read a
<i>Geneva</i> bible without spectacles. A certificate of this miraculous
cure, I have under the hand of the parson of the parish, and his
amen-curler.</p>

<p>I cured a <i>Kentish</i> parson of an <i>Infirmitas MemoriÃ¦</i>, which he got
by a jumble of his <i>Glandula Pinealis</i>, after a bowl of punch and a
boxing-bout. He was reducâ€™d to that deplorable condition, as to
turn over play-books instead of his concordance, quote <i>QuÃ¦ Genus</i>
instead of St. <i>Austin</i>; nay, he forgot tythe-eggs, demanded
<i>Easter</i> dues at <i>Martinmas</i>, bid <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i> instead of
<i>Ash-Wednesday</i>; and frequently mistook the service of matrimony,
for that of the dead: what is yet more surprising, he forgot even
to drink over his left thumb; but now he has as staunch a memory,
as a pawn-broker for the day of the month; a country attorney for
mischief; or a popish clergyman for revenge.</p>

<p>I cured serjeant <i>Dolthead</i>, of a prodigious itch in the palms of
his hands: A most wonderful cure! for now he refuses fees, as
heartily as a young wench does an ugly fellow, when she has a
handsome one in view; his attorney is run mad, his wife is turnâ€™d
bawd to take double fees; and his daughters mantua-makers and
whores, to get by two trades.</p>

<p>An eminent coach-keeping physician was troubled with a <i>Farrago
Medicinarum</i>, or a <i>Tumor Prescriptionalis</i> to that monstrous
degree, that he writ bills by the ell, and prescribed medicines by
the hogshead and wheelbarrow-full. To the amazement of all that
knew him: I have effectually cured him onâ€™t; for he now writes but
three words, prescribes but two scruples, leaves people to a
wholesome kitchen-diet, and nature has undone the sexton and
funeral undertaker; and the overstockâ€™d parish has petitioned the
privy-council to send out a new coloney to the <i>West-Indies</i>.</p>

<p>I cured a certain head of a college, of a <i>Hebetude Cerebri</i>; so
that he now jokes with the bachelors and junior<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_150">{150}</a></span> fry, goes to the
dancing-school with the fellow-commoners; and next act will be able
to make a whole <i>terrÃ¦ filius</i>â€™s speech himself.</p>

<p>An apothecary in <i>Cheapside</i>, was so strangely over-run with an
<i>Inundatio Veneni</i>, that the grass grew in the parish round him;
but now, thanks to the cure I wrought upon him, he has reducâ€™d his
shop to the compass of a raree-show, gets but ten pence in the
shilling, let the neighbouring infants grow up to men; and is going
to build an hospital for decayâ€™d prize-fighters and dragoons.</p>

<p>I cured a vintner behind the <i>Exchange</i>, of a <i>Mixtura Diabolica</i>,
so that now he hates apples as much as our forefather after his
kick on the arse out of paradice; shuns a drugsterâ€™s shop, as much
as a broken cit does a serjeant; swears heâ€™ll clear but ten
thousand pounds in five years, and then set up for psalm-singing,
and sleeping under the pulpit.</p>

<p>I cured a <i>Norfolk</i> attorney of the <i>Scabies Causidico Rabularies</i>,
another prodigious cure never performâ€™d before; so that now heâ€™s as
quiet as a crambâ€™d capon among barn door hens, he wonâ€™t so much as
scratch for his food; his uncle the counseller has disinherited
him; and since he has listed himself for a foot soldier.</p>

<p>I cured an <i>Amsterdam</i> burgomasterâ€™s wife of barrenness, so that
now she has two children at a birth; besides a brace of sooterkins
every year, and even now in these low-countries (so effectual are
my remedies) I am teazâ€™d with daily messages, for astringents and
flood gates, to help the poor pains-taking mortal in his aquatic
situation.</p>

<p><i>Pierre Babillard</i>, <i>French</i> valet and pimp in ordinary to my lord
<i>Demure</i>, was troubled with the <i>Glosso-mania</i>, or that epidemical
disease of <i>Normandy</i>, the talking sickness. He not only prattled
all night in his sleep, but his clack went incessantly all day
long; the cook-maid and nurse were talkâ€™d quite deaf by him;
whereas his master labourâ€™d under the contrary extreme, and by his
good will wouâ€™d not strike once in twenty four hours; by the most
stupendous operation that ever was known, (for the transfusion of
one animalâ€™s blood into another, so much boasted of by the royal
society, is not to be compared to it) I transfused some of the
<i>French</i> valetâ€™s loquacity into the noble peer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_151">{151}</a></span> and some of the
noble peerâ€™s taciturnity into the <i>French</i> valet; so that now, to
the great consolation of the family, my lord sometimes talks, and
Monsieur <i>Babillard</i> sometimes holds his tongue.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Blunder Dullman</i>, professor of rhetorick, and orator to the
ancient city of <i>Augusta Trinobantum</i>, had been troubled, ever from
his infancy with that epidemical magistrateâ€™s distemper, the <i>Bos</i>
in <i>Lingua</i>; so that whenever he made any speeches, the gentlemen
were ready to split their sides, and the ladies to bepiss
themselves with laughing at the singularities of his discourse. By
my <i>Pulvis Cephalicus</i>, I so far recoverâ€™d him, that he couâ€™d draw
up his tropes and metaphors in good order, and harangue you twenty
lines upon the stretch, without making above the same number of
blunders. If he has since relapsed, â€™tis no fault of mine, but he
may eâ€™en thank his city conversation for it.</p>

<p><i>Dinah Fribble</i>, eldest daughter to <i>Jonathan Fribble</i> of
<i>Thames-street</i>, tallow-chandler, was so enormously given to the
language of old <i>Babylon</i>, that she would talk bawdy before her
mother, her grandmother, and godmother; nay, name the two beastly
monosyllables before the doctor and lecturer of the parish. Her
father, one of the worshipful elders of <i>Salters-hall</i>, wondered
how a child so religiously educated, fed from her cradle with the
crumbs of comfort, and lullâ€™d daily asleep with <i>Hopkins</i> and
<i>Sternhold</i>, should labour under so obscene a dispensation. In
short, I was sent for, pourâ€™d some twenty drops of my
<i>Anti-Asmodean</i> essence into her nostrils, and the next morning a
huge thundering <i>Priapus</i> eleven inches long, came out of her left
ear; sheâ€™s now perfectly recoverâ€™d, talks as piously, and behaves
herself as gravely as the demurest female in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Daniel Guzzle</i>, Inn-keeper in <i>Southwark</i>, by perpetual tippling
with his customers, was so inordinately swellâ€™d with a dropsy, that
Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>, in <i>Harry</i> the fourth, was a meer skeleton to
him. I tappâ€™d his <i>Heidelburg-Abdomen</i>, and so vast an inundation
issued from him, that if the stream had continued a quarter of an
hour longer, it would have overflowed the whole borough, and made a
second cataclysm. He is now perfectly cured, is as slender as a
beau that has been twice sa<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_152">{152}</a></span>livated for a shape; runs up the
monument some half a score times every morning for his diversion,
jumps throâ€™ a hoop, makes nothing of leaping over a five-barrâ€™d
gate; and the famous Mr. <i>Barnes</i> of <i>Rotherhith</i> has enterâ€™d him
into his company.</p>

<p><i>Obadiah Hemming</i>, Taylor, at the sign of the <i>Red-Wastcoat</i> and
<i>Blazing-Star</i>, near <i>Tower-Hill</i>, was troubled with so unmerciful
a <i>Ptisick</i>, that no body in the family could sleep for him: I
plyâ€™d him with my <i>Antitussient Pillula Pulmonaris</i>, but without
effect. I wondered how the devil my never-failing remedy
disappointed me! cries I to him, honest friend, what may your name
be? <i>Obadiah Hemming</i>, says he. Very well; and what parish do you
live in; <i>All-hallows-Barking</i>. Oh, ho! I have now found out the
secret how my pills came to miscarry; why, friend, thou hast a
damnâ€™d ptisical name, and livest in a confounded ptisical parish:
come call thyself <i>Obadiah Bowman</i>, and get thee to <i>Hampstead</i>,
<i>Highgate</i>, or any place but <i>All-hallows-Barking</i>, and Iâ€™ll insure
thy recovery. He did so; and is so strangely improvâ€™d upon it, that
he is since chosen into St. <i>Paul</i>â€™s choir, and begins to rival Mr.
<i>Goslin</i> and Mr. <i>Elford</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rebbecca Twist</i>, Ribbon-Weaver, in <i>Drum-Alley, Spittle Fields</i>,
aged 75, by drinking anniseed-robin, geneva, and other ungodly
liquors, and smoaking mundungus, had so utterly decayed her natural
heat, that she had lain bed-rid thirty years, and on my conscience
a calenture would no more have warmâ€™d her, than a farthing candle
would roast a sirloin of beef. I made so entire a renovation of her
with my <i>Arcanum Helmontio-Glaubero-Paracelsianum</i>, that sheâ€™s
become another creature, out-talks the parson and midwife at every
gossiping, dances to a miracle, never fails to give her attendance
at all merry meetings; and no sooner hears the noise of a fiddle,
but she frisks and capers it about, like a young hoyden of fifteen.</p>

<p><i>Nehemiah Conniver</i>, one of the city reformers, was so totally
deformâ€™d with the <i>Lepra Hypocritica</i>, that never a barber,
victualler, or taylor in the neighbourhood could live in quiet for
him. To the admiration of all that knew him, I have so effectually
cured him of this acid humour, that he will out-swear ten dragoons,
go to a bawdy-house<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_153">{153}</a></span> in the face of the sun; and out talk a score
of midwives in natural philosophy.</p>

<p>Thus, gentlemen, you have my bill, and catalogue of cures, by which
youâ€™ll easily perceive that our internal world is only a
counter-part of yourâ€™s, where hard words, impudence, and nonsense,
delivered with a magisterial air, carry every thing before them. I
should now according to the method proposed to myself, proceed to
give you a short account of what memorable occurrences have lately
happened in these <i>Acherontic</i> realms, but the vast crowds of
visitants at my door are so obstreporous and troublesome, that I
can conceal myself from them no longer. Be pleasâ€™d, therefore, to
accept of this imperfect relation in part of payment, and next
month, when I shall have a better convenience of writing my
thoughts at large, I will endeavour to give you full satisfaction.
In the mean time, give me leave to assure you, that my highest
ambition is to honour myself with the title of,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is some time since (you know) that I took my leave of you, and the
sun, and I fearâ€™d of all good company too. My curiosity to observe the
nature of an affair, whereof every body talks, thoâ€™ not one of them can
understand, made me so long silent; that if it were possible I might
give my friends some account or other that should be of moment to them,
either for diversion or improvement. Your weighty affairs prevent the
one, and your capacity the other; but that you may see friendship as
well as virtue survives the grave, I address this to you, to assure you,
we are not annihilated, as some philosophers opened, and that our
felicity does not consist in an unactive indolence as others as vainly
pretended. Virtue is its own reward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_154">{154}</a></span> and vice its own punishment. We
are so refined here, that nothing can veil evil from the piercing eyes
of every body, and the malice and envy of the most inveterate devils
cannot over-cast the glories of the good. We impute a great many faults
to the frailty of the flesh very unjustly. The soul hath its warpings as
well as the clay, and some vices are so natural that we cannot
extinguish them, thoâ€™ we may in some measure prevent their flaming out
and boiling over. These remain still, and employ all the utmost efforts
of our prudence to triumph over; and if we accomplish that, we are
perfect; but if the malignity of our tempers prevail, we sink to the
lowest abyss of infamy, shame, and disgrace. This laid the foundation of
that doctrine of <i>Rome</i>, called Purgatory; and their ignorance, joined
to their insatiable avarice, improved it to what at present you find it.
Here is one duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, perpetually conferring with the
<i>Spanish</i> ministers; the other as busy in finding out the mighty secrets
of impertinent curiosities; hereâ€™s <i>Mazarine</i> supplanting the liberty of
<i>Europe</i>, and <i>Cromwell</i> that of <i>England</i>. <i>Shaftsbury</i> is pushing on
<i>Monmouth</i>, and he is stiled king by one of his own footmen only;
<i>Dryden</i> is every minute at <i>Homer</i>â€™s heels, or pulling <i>Virgil</i> by the
sleeve, importuning <i>Horace</i>, or making friends to <i>Ovid</i>: but <i>Cowley</i>,
with a serenity of mind that constitutes his felicity, quietly passes
along the <i>Elysian</i> plains, disturbing no body, and undisturbâ€™d of all,
<i>Milton</i> his companion, and himself his happiness. The less considerable
fry of wits are just as contentious here, as at <i>Covent Garden</i>; as
noisy, and as ill-naturâ€™d; every man in particular arrogating all to
himself, and allowing nothing to others. The dispute rose so high, and
the uproar continued so long, that <i>Pluto</i> commanded a squadron of his
life-guard, with <i>Juvenal</i> at their head, to force them out of the
laurel-grove, and lock it up till matters should be adjusted by
<i>Apollo</i>, to whom he detachâ€™d <i>Lucan</i> and <i>Lee</i> (as being the best
skillâ€™d in flying) with his complaints; they are returned with a
proclamation, which for its novelty I will trouble you with; not but
that I think it might not improperly have been made on the other side of
<i>Parnassus</i>, unless matters are strangely mended since I left you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_155">{155}</a></span></p>

and heart-burns are ever and anon kindled, stirrâ€™d up, and fomented
among the elder brothers of</i> Helicon, <i>as well as the multitude of
vain pretenders to bayes and immortality, in so much, that your

inconveniency to the good and just; and an unhappy suspension of

infractions of the peace of our uncle king</i> Plutoâ€™<i>s dominions:

their chiefest delight; â€™tis their park, their playhouse, their
assembly. I find all the vices of the mind are common here, as in
your superiour regions: separating from the clay has only taken
from us the means of whoring and drinking, but the mind retains
still the wicked propensity. I considered not the pressing number
of your affairs, and that I hazard your ill-will by detaining you
so long from the publick: give me leave only to desire the favour
of you, when your servant goes through <i>Chancery-lane</i>, to put up a
cargo of the <i>spread-eagle</i> pudding for our very good friend

<h2><i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Prior</span><i>â€™s Answer</i>.</h2>

<p><i>Worthy Sir</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> WAS not wanting in my wishes to preserve that esteem you honoured
me with, or to give you fresher instances of it; but since your
stars summoned you on the other side of the black water, and I did
not know whither to address myself exactly to you, I was obliged to
suspend my writing till such time as I received yourâ€™s. I am
heartily glad the two crowns are agreed to permit a pacquet to go
between them; and as for our friend the counsellor, I never shall
be dilatory in serving him to the utmost of my abilities, and never
shall call to mind but with veneration and wonder, his most heroick
conduct and magnanimity in pudding-fighting. He sequesterâ€™d himself
from flesh and blood very opportunely, and with a prudence that
always accompanied him in the minutest of his actions; for sugars
and fruits are risen already, and, in all probability, will
continue to bear a good price, since <i>Portugal</i> has deserted us; so
I dare not pretend to be positive that the cargo I send will be as
delicious as formerly, thoâ€™ its novelty may make amends for some
time, for small cheats in that profession. Honest <i>John</i> the
faithful companion of your wanton hours, was very much rejoiced to
hear from you, and would needs take a leap after you, maugre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_157">{157}</a></span> all I
could say to him: with this trusty servant I have sent you what you
desired, and that I might be certain of its not miscarrying any
where upon the road, I tuckâ€™d friend <i>John</i> up with it, and so
dispatchâ€™d him presently. I was in hopes to have heard from more of
our merry companions, or of them at least: how does <i>Rochester</i>
behave himself with his old gang? is Sir <i>George</i> as facetious as
ever? is my lady still that formal creature as when in our
hemisphere? has she the benefit of cards and a tea-table? how did
my lord <i>Jefferies</i> receive his son? and with what constancy did
her grace hear Sir <i>John Germain</i> was married? I was in hopes you
might have met with some of these in your peregrination, not that I
suppose you can see those vast dominions of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s but in a
proportionable time to the variety of subjects, as well as the
mightiness of their extent.</p>

<p>We have nothing new here, because we are under the sun. Wise men
keep company with one another; fools write and fools read; the
booksellers have the advantage, provided they donâ€™t trust; some
pragmatical fellows set up for politicians; others think they have
merit because they have money. Cheats prosper, drunkenness is a
little rebuked in the pulpit, but as rife as ever in all other
places; people marry that donâ€™t love one the other, and your old
mistress <i>Melisinda</i> goes to church constantly, prays devoutly,
sings psalms gravely, hears sermons attentively, receives the
sacrament monthly, lies with her footman nightly, and rails against
lewdness and hypocrisy from morning till night.</p>

<p>The rest of particulars I leave for honest <i>John</i> to recount to
you; my other affairs oblige me to take my leave of you; expecting
some particulars about what I mentioned myself.</p>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE sons and daughters of harmony that crowd in daily upon these coasts
surprise us equally with your capacities and misfortunes. We are
generally of the opi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_158">{158}</a></span>nion here, that the muses are as well receivâ€™d in
<i>England</i>, as in any other climate whatever. Men are charmâ€™d there at so
small an expence of wit or performance, that, one of your endowments
might well have hopâ€™d to outrival my felicity, and be something more
exalted than to the embraces of a queen. My parentage was as little
remarkable in <i>France</i>, as yours in <i>England</i>; and though I had better
luck, durst not pretend I had a better voice. From a singing-boy, I
pushâ€™d my fortune so as to succeed my own sovereign. From the choir I
rose to the chamber; from the chamber I was preferrâ€™d to the closet; and
from thence was advancâ€™d to be vice-roy over all the territories of
love: I was lord high-chamberlain to <i>Cupid</i>, and comptroller of the
houshold to <i>Venus</i>. Every delectation superseded my very wishes; nor
couâ€™d I have askâ€™d for the thousandth part of the blandishments I
enjoyâ€™d. I was as absolute in my love as the grand seignior: â€™twas for
my dear sake the fond princess raisâ€™d her maids of honourâ€™s beds, that
she might not hurt her back (as she had frequently done) in creeping
under to fetch me out. â€™Twas for my dear sake, that if they but namâ€™d my
name when absent, in the raptures of her impatience, she run against the
doors, threw down the screens; hurt her face against the mantle-trees
and cabinets. She broke at times as much in looking-glasses, stands, and
china, in the eager transports of her joy to meet me coming into the
room, as by computation, wouâ€™d have fitted out a fleet of fifty sail of
capital ships. These were princely rewards for a manâ€™s poor endeavours
to please: who would not bring up their children in a choir? or who
would not learn to sing? you have met, I must confess, Sir, with but
small encouragement in the main, and made but a slender fortune in
comparison of what might have been reasonably expected from your
talents: the most civilizâ€™d quarter of the world has been your audience,
and admirer; and you have left every where a name, that cannot die but
with musick, and that will survive even nature; for in the numerous
cracklings of the last conflagration, there will be, as it were, a noble
symphony, that she may cease to be in proportion, and what is her
apothesis, will draw the curtain to a new creation. But that enlargement
of our knowledge, which is the necessity of our spiritualization, shows
me there is a malevolency<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_159">{159}</a></span> in the influences of your stars, that will
ever dash your rising hopes, and oppose your fortune. You cannot but
have heard how <i>Alexander the Great</i> very generously distributed all the
spoils to his soldiers, and contented himself with glory for his
dividend. Thus your consolation must be, whenever the fickle goddess
frowns upon you; that noble resolution of being above contempt, shows a
magnanimity of mind equal to the greatest philosopher. But virtue is
very often unfortunate, nay, sometimes oppressâ€™d.</p>

<p>Here are some devilish, ignorant, censorious, lying people, that will
maintain, you were so impertinent as to give a gentleman, the trouble of
cudgelling you, and there are many here whose wicked tempers are
improvâ€™d by the conversation of the place, as rogues by being in
<i>Newgate</i>, and those give credit to the aspersions; but the tribe of
<i>Helicon</i> endeavour your justification, for he that couâ€™d charm the king
of <i>Poland</i>â€™s bears with the warbling accents of his mellifluous tongue,
might with the same harmony have movâ€™d the sturdy oak, and that is as
heavy as a hundred canes. â€™Twas the glory of <i>Arion</i>, that the stones
danced after his lyre; and as long as there are poets it will be said,
that <i>Orpheus</i> drew the tigers and the trees, to listen to his trembling
lays. May you not justly expect a place in the volumes of immortality,
since it may be all said literally true of you, that was but a fable of
these darlings of our forefathers? no matter if some people put an ill
construction on it, the best actions of our lives are subject to be
traducâ€™d.&#8212;&#8212; Here was a dear joy of quality sufferâ€™d the discipline of
the place for stealing the diamond ring from you, that the king of
<i>France</i> gave you at <i>Fountainbleau</i>: to mitigate the blackness of the
fact, he alledgâ€™d the necessitousness of his condition, and that it was
pity so many gallant men should want for their loyalty, while a
jackanapes couâ€™d get an estate for a song. At this, <i>Rhadamanthus</i>
orderâ€™d him a hundred stripes more for his pride in affecting a
character his own confession had so far derogated from. There are some
considerable stars that rise in <i>Bavaria</i>, whose influences are
inauspicious to you; for, among friends, â€™twas no better than robbing
him to run away with his money, and especially before you had done any
thing for it. However, this may be your consolation, that the duke canâ€™t
say you cheated him to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span> tune. Here is a consort of musick composing
against the king of <i>France</i> makes his entrance: out of gratitude to his
generosity, you ought to make one of â€™em; I can get you a lodging near
<i>Cerberus</i>â€™s apartment; â€™twill be convenient for you to confer notes
together for he is much the deepest base of any here.</p>

<p>If your leisure will permit, I should be glad of some news from the

the <i>Sulphurstreet</i>. I shall look upon the obligation in <i>Ala-mi-re</i> in
<i>Alt</i>.</p>

<h2><a id="Mr_Abels_Answer"></a><i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Abelâ€™</span><i>s Answer</i>.</h2>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>F the advice be seasonable, â€™tis no great matter from whence it comes;
though â€™tis not what one wouâ€™d readily expect from a person of your
climate; but that too renders the obligation so much the more binding. I
was not so well acquainted with the ancient intrigues of the <i>French</i>
court as to call your name to remembrance, but by the delicious
expression of your wanton delights, I presumâ€™d you might have been a
<i>Mahometan</i> eunuch, because you seemâ€™d to describe their paradice in
part; what couâ€™d I tell whether more of that felicity came to your share
or not? I met <i>Aben-Ezra</i> the <i>Jew</i>, but he knew nothing of you; at last
a <i>French</i> refugee set me right. When I consider your private history I
am amazâ€™d at your raptures, and that you could be so void of common
reason, more especially after you had been so long spiritualizâ€™d, which
you tell me, enlarges the understanding, as to set a value upon your
self for raking a kennel, only because it belonged to court. To have
charmâ€™d a person of an exalted extraction, as I did, and to bring her to
be the loving wife of my bosom, was vanity without infamy. But your
captive queen was a queen of sluts, equally the infamy of her own sex,
as you were the contempt of ours. â€™Twas very pathetically said of her by
her brother, when he gave her in marriage to the king of <i>Navarre, that
he did not give his</i> Peggy <i>in marriage to the king of</i> Navarre <i>alone,
but to all the</i> Hugonots <i>of his kingdom</i>, and if he had said, all the
<i>Roman Catholicks</i> too, it had hardly been<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_161">{161}</a></span> an hyperbole. For ever since
she was nine years old, she never denyâ€™d any thing that was a man; no,
not so much as her own brother. She had so great an inclination to be
obliging, that she would not refuse even old age, and did not condemn
even the blackest scullion-boy of her kitchin: she was the refuse of a
hundred thousand several menâ€™s embraces before she took up with you. So
that I see no such mighty ground for your vanity and ostentation: and if
there were not other more beneficial expectations from the choir, I
should advise but very few to follow it: not but that a fair friend in
the <i>Palace-yard</i>, a kind friend in <i>Charles-street</i>, or a pretty
intimate acquaintance near the <i>Bowling-Alley</i>, may help to pass away
some leisure hours when the <i>Abbey</i> is lockâ€™d up; however that is not
sufficient to tempt a man to <i>C-fa-ut</i> it all ones life-time.</p>

<p>I ever found an inbred aversion to <i>Ireland</i>, and your news gives me
more convincing reasons why I should not affect â€™em: for to be strippâ€™d
by some, and strippâ€™d by others, would of itself give a man an
unfavourable Impression of such people. As for the freedom you take in
diverting yourself at my expence, I easily pass it by: but your
censoriousness scandalizes me, when so many very deserving persons of
all ranks, sexes and qualities, as are my good friends and benefactors,
are made the subject of your raillery. I do not want to be spiritualisâ€™d
to see throâ€™ your banter, when you make me even superior to <i>Orpheus</i>
and <i>Arion</i>; I smell what you wouâ€™d be at, by being followâ€™d by tigers,
blocks and stones: but it is lucky enough for you, that you are out of
their reach: as for the article of <i>Bavaria</i>, I can say but little to it
more than I thought the time was come, when the <i>Israelites</i> should
spoil the <i>Egyptians</i>. You have such continual couriers from these
parts, that you cannot be long ignorant of the minutest springs by which
all affairs are kept in motion. To me they seem everywhere to be at much
the same rate, like a horse in a mill, â€™tis no matter who drives him. I
thank you for your kind offer, in providing me lodgings; but I have so
many of my friends gone there of late, that I shall unwillingly be from
them: however, I shall always study to improve your good opinion, and
continue theirs. If any accident calls me to your parts about that time,
I shall gladly assist at the king of <i>France</i>â€™s entry; for doubt<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_162">{162}</a></span>less it
will be done with a most noble solemnity, and every way answerable to
the character of such a monarch. But as time is more precious here than
in your country, I must beg you to excuse me, for I am just sent for to
the tavern. <i>Adieu.</i></p>

blaspheming rascals, smoaking sots, noisy boobies, and such nefarious

and a pair of wrought tongs. One of their own jigs is diverting enough
for their heavy capacities; whence comes it that the sons of art, and
the brothers of rosin and cat-gut, can demean themselves so poorly to
play before them? since when have the daughters of <i>Helicon</i> frequented
ale-houses? must the sacred streams of our <i>Aganiope</i>, pay homage to the
<i>Darwent</i>, and wash tankards and glasses? sure you think <i>Pegasus</i> a
jade, and are looking out for a chap for him: who can come up to his
price there? his beauties are too sublime for the groom, and his master
had rather have a strong horse for his coach: none of them alas can tilt
the fiery courser. What a strange medley do you make! wit, musick,
noise, nonsense, smoak, spawl, <i>Darby</i>-ale, and brandy: nay your rage
and indiscretion goes farther yet; folly and madness seem to be
contagious, and you jar among yourselves? the brothers of symphony
quarrel, and turn the banquetting-house of the <i>Thessalian</i> ladies into
a bear-garden, those active joints that so nicely touchâ€™d my notes, are
now barbarously levellâ€™d at each otherâ€™s eyes; the pow<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_163">{163}</a></span>erful off-spring
of my harmonious conceptions, is miserably torn to pieces betwixt them;
and what would have charmâ€™d all mankind, is dishonourably employâ€™d to
the lighting of pipes and cleaning of tables. If you will set up for
celebrating the orgies of the juicy god, let your instruments be all
chosen accordingly, your airs correspondent to the audience; but make me
no more the contempt and derision of your debauchâ€™d meetings: for the
commendation of fools is more wounding than the reprimands of the
ingenious. At best, it is prostituting me to bring them into my company.
If you put not some sudden order to these ignominious proceedings, I
will dispatch an imp to sowre your ale, consume your cordials, spill
your tobacco, break your glasses, and cut all your equipage of harmony
into ten thousand millions of bits; nay I will prosecute my revenge so
far, that even in the play-house your hand shall shake, your ear shall
judge wrong, your strings crack, and every disappointment that may
render you ridiculous, shall attend you in all publick meetings
where-ever you pretend to play. So be wise and be warnâ€™d: play to lovers

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OUR eminencyâ€™s remissness in the late affairs of the <i>Spanish</i>
territories, has made my scorpionâ€™s stink deeper than heretofore, and
superadded a new blackness to the horrors of my rage and despair. Those
painful machinations, who took their birth from hell itself, and by my
industry and application had so glorious a prospect of bridling all
mankind, wherever the <i>Romish</i> doctrine triumphâ€™d at least, are now by
that long continued series of an unhappy supineness in your
predecessors, or the powerful influences of <i>French</i> gold, reducâ€™d to
almost nothing. The thunderbolts of the inquisition rattled more
dreadfully than those of the <i>Vatican</i>; and after emperors had subjected
themselves to the successors of St. <i>Peter</i>, we found out means to
subject him to our censures, and by this made our selves superior to
supreme. The mildness of your executions, and the rarity of â€™em have
substracted wonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_164">{164}</a></span>fully from their reputation, and from my designs.
Your excellency canâ€™t say but I lay down very sufficient groundworks for
the rendering my orders as lasting as religion, if not as lasting as
time. More than <i>Europe</i> has felt the efficacy of my instructions; and
where-ever my disciples have been sent they have brought us home souls
and bodies, credit and estates.</p>

<p>What society can vie with us for extent of temporal concerns? what
provinces are not in a great measure ours? we have the guardianship of
the consciences of most of the considerable crownâ€™d heads, and few
affairs of importance are transacted any where but with our privity. I
have not met with any one person in these kingdoms that has been of note
and quality, that came here with a pass-port from the holy inquisition;
now and then a rascally <i>Jew</i> or so, comes here blaspheming your power
and prudence; and is so angry that he will not show it at hell-gates; as
if he apprehended a double damnation from our character.</p>

<p>Your excellency canâ€™t but be sensible how great sufferers we have been
by the substracting of the <i>Gallican</i> church from the lash of our
authority; and it was no small amputation we suffered in the <i>Spanish
Netherlands</i>, by the improvident proceeding of that rash commander the
duke of <i>Alva</i>: If now you submit thus quietly to the administration of
<i>France</i>, I cannot but apprehend an universal extention of that powerful
and profitable institution. Next to my own society, I look upon it to be
the basis of the <i>Romish</i> monarchy, and undoubtedly of your own, and of
the <i>Austrian</i> greatness. How are your liberties trampled upon by a
child, and all your dons led captives to <i>Versailles</i>? Where is the
antient valour and obstinacy of the <i>Moorish</i> blood? Where are the
poisons and the poniards so frequent in <i>Madrid</i>? Is <i>Spain</i> brought so
low that she has not resolution enough for one feeble effort, to save
herself from infamy and ruin? Your arms were always unsuccessful against
the <i>English</i> nation; the greatness of your misery points out still the
memorable, the very deplorable overthrow in eighty eight: There is a
queen again upon that crown, willing and able to protect you as well as
others, and it may be in rubricks of fate, that as one queen brought
down the pride of the haughty <i>Spaniards</i>, so the other shall humble
<i>France</i> as much, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_165">{165}</a></span> when it is in its most towâ€™ring glory. But
whatever be the destiny of <i>France</i>, you ought to look after yourselves,
and not by an untimely accession of your powers to that of so formidable
a monarch, intangle yourselves in an inextricable ruin, by so much the
more unpardonable as you might easily have prevented it. Shew the world
then that a <i>French</i> lion canâ€™t thrive in a <i>Spanish</i> soil, and dart
forth the lightning of the inquisition against all that adhere to the
<i>Gallic</i> interest and connive at the ruin of the <i>Spanish</i> grandeur.
Exert yourself and swim hither in a sea of blood, and may your cruelties
succeed.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Ever had an infinite value for your friendship, and as every letter is
a fresh mark of it, I have in every one new matter of satisfaction; yet
I could not read your last without equal surprize and concern; and if I
did not positively believe your integrity, as I am acquainted with your
capacity, I should be at a loss what construction to put upon it: for
all <i>Europe</i> has been deaf for I know not how many years, with more and
more accounts how your kings grew upon their people, and we ever lookâ€™d
upon the <i>English</i> as very jealous of their privileges. I need not tell
you how odious your two last kings were to us of these parts; nay, and
all <i>Germany</i> too, papist and protestant; for instead of holding the
balance between <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i> and the <i>Empire</i>, as the situation of
your country, and its mighty power by sea made â€™em capable of doing, and
the character of guarantees for the peace of <i>Nimeguen</i>, and the truce
for twenty years obligâ€™d â€™em to it; their siding with <i>France</i>,
notwithstanding all the endeavours of foreign ministers to the contrary,
and their own real interest too, may be justly said to have laid the
foundation of all those calamities that the arms and intrigues of
<i>France</i>, have since that time brought upon <i>Europe</i>. But thoâ€™ we had so
many reasons to be dissatisfied with the proceedings of king <i>Charles</i>
II. and king <i>James</i> too, yet we never diminishâ€™d any thing of our good
will we bore the <i>English</i> nation; because we couâ€™d not but believe they
were as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">{166}</a></span> far from approving those transactions as we were, and repinâ€™d
as much as we did at the growing grandeur of the <i>French</i> monarch. The
clandestine measures both those kings took to enslave their subjects to
the power of <i>France</i>, and the <i>Romish</i> religion, was as good a
demonstration of a natural enmity between those two sorts of people. His
present majestyâ€™s descent was concerted with most of the princes of the
empire after it was so earnestly proposâ€™d to him, and almost pressâ€™d
upon him by the very best of your nation. The friendship between the two
crowns was no longer a secret, thoâ€™ the <i>English</i> envoy at the <i>Hague</i>
denyâ€™d it positively when I was there: This was more than an umbrage to
the discerning part of your kingdom, and what the very commonality could
not think on without terrible apprehensions: and all of us here in like
manner lookâ€™d upon this enterprize as a thing on which depended the
safety or ruin of the whole protestant affairs of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot comprehend what unlucky planet rules over you! that any one
person should be dissatisfyâ€™d, is prodigious to me. You are freed from
all those oppressions, whose probability alone having made no small part
of your misery. You were very uneasy under the administration of king
<i>James</i>, and now you are deliverâ€™d, you murmur! you know his royal
highness was so unwilling to embark himself in this affair, thoâ€™ his
interest and his honour were very much concernâ€™d at it, that he did not
yield but to the iterated solicitations of your countrymen, joinâ€™d with
full assurance that they would stand by him with their lives and
fortunes. You must pardon the freedom of my expression, if I assure you,
that this ungrateful false step lessens my value for the <i>English</i>
nation: for after having made such terrible complaints of their miseries
and injuries, and fillâ€™d <i>Europe</i> with their tears and lamentations,
implorâ€™d a neighbouring prince to come to their rescue, at a season of
the year that wouâ€™d have quellâ€™d the greatest courage that ever was, if
it had not been supported with charity; and add to this, the unavoidable
necessity of so vast an expence, as would have sunk some princes
fortunes, now they are happily settled in their affairs at home, have
glorious armies abroad, and that king at their head, who has so justly
merited that title of <i>Defender of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_167">{167}</a></span> the Faith</i>, whose prudence and
vigilancy has corroborated their native force with so many powerful
allies; that these people should be so little sensible of their own
felicity, as to murmur and be discontented, is to me a paradox, but I am
sure unpardonable. The knowledge I have of the <i>English</i> genius, makes
me believe there are but a few malecontents, and thoâ€™ they call
themselves protestants, â€™tis only to bring an odium upon those that
really are, by such perverse measures. I hope â€™tis only your fears for
your country, which proceed from your love of it, that multiplies these
disagreeable objects. You have a protestant prince, on a protestant
throne, liberty of conscience, and even the <i>Roman Catholicks</i>, that
were always plotting against the government, are permitted so much
freedom under it, that they would be mad if they were out of it.</p>

<p>Look back to the desolations in <i>France</i>, and to the storm you are
deliverâ€™d from, and see if you can ever thank God enough for your
deliverance.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E had no sooner intelligence of your designs, but we gave the
<i>Spaniards</i> over for lost: the path has been so gallantly beaten to your
hands, and your enemies hardly recruited their former losses in our
glorious times, if they couâ€™d have forgot from whose hands they
sustainâ€™d â€™em. If I may remind you without vanity, as I do it without a
lie, I took the lower town of the <i>Groyn</i>, I plunderâ€™d all the villages
round about it, and by the gallantry of the <i>English</i> cut the
<i>Spaniards</i> to pieces for three miles together. But these were professâ€™d
enemies that had attempted upon our state, and by their formidable
preparations, threatned no less than our entire ruin. However, in all
the licentiousness of a conquering sword, we ravishâ€™d no nuns; and it
had been justifiable if we had done<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_168">{168}</a></span> it. We took the city of <i>St.
Joseph</i>, and thoâ€™ there was not found one single piece of coinâ€™d money
in it (which is a very exasperating disappointment to soldiers you know)
yet we forcâ€™d no nunneries. Had you two, gentlemen, been there, I
presume you wouâ€™d have eaten the children alive for mere madness and
vexation, after you had gratifyâ€™d your more unpardonable brutish lusts
upon the monasteries. Distressed damsels were heretofore the general
cause for which the heroes drew their swords: as their sex made them the
objects of our desires, so when their weakness was forcâ€™d upon, they
became doubly the subjects of our quarrels, and by so just a claim, that
nothing but the very reproach of mankind refusâ€™d it â€™em. Your case, as I
take it (gentlemen) is far different from that, where positive orders
give licence; nay, an insurrection itself, and to lay all waste before
you; to ransack the churches, and ravish the women, to burn the houses,
and brain the sucking children; these are political rigors, that by a
present shedding of blood, saves the lives of many thousands afterwards:
this putting all to the sword, intimidates small towns for making feeble
efforts for an impossible defence; which by losing some time, and some
few menâ€™s lives only, enrages the conquerer at last, to use the same
severity with them too, to punish their obstinacy. These are bloody
maxims of war, but necessary sometimes, therefore lawful. But you
(gentlemen) had not the least shadow of pretence for your lust or your
avarice: if these are the insolent effects of your friendship, I fear no
body will admit of your alliances, much less court them. Friendship
betrayâ€™d, is the blackest crime that is, and what so far degrades a
gentleman from the character of honour, that miracles of bravery in
sieges afterwards wouâ€™d never wear out the blot: but as if you had
resolved to make yourselves odious, by making the fact more infamous,
they must be nuns too, forsooth, that must be constrained to your
libidinous authority. Your sacrilegious covetousness might have met with
a shadow of excuse, if your intemperance had proceeded no farther: and
indeed they must have a great deal of wit as well as goodness, that can
invent any thing like a reason to mitigate the abomination of it. You,
old commanders, you, old covetous lechers, the bane of an army, the
reproach of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_169">{169}</a></span> the best general, and of the most glorious princess. What
laurels have your lust and rapines torn from <i>O</i>&#8212;&#8212;â€™s brows? What
honours from your <i>English</i> arms? And what vast advantages from your own
sovereign? Had not your impious carriage made implacable enemies of
those that were not quite resolved to continue long so at all, this
summer had raisâ€™d your princess to that pinnacle of renown and grandeur,
that none ever surpassâ€™d, and but few ever came up to besides our
illustrious queen, of whom no man can say too much; therefore of you,
gentlemen, none can say too ill. A design so deeply laid, so cautiously
managâ€™d, so long concealâ€™d, so wisely concerted, couâ€™d not possibly miss
of a happy event, if your impious indignities had not constrained heaven
to blast the undertaking, to shew it was just; thus the army perished
for <i>David</i>â€™s having numbred the people: you went to free â€™em from a
foreign dominion, to settle the right of government in the right person,
to prevent innovations, and relieve the oppressâ€™d; in a word, to do
justice to every subject. Oh, the plausible pretext! the noble reasons
for so chargeable an expedition! yet no sooner has the justice of the
cause in general crownâ€™d your attempts with success, but your particular
outrages pull down vengeance, and raise yourselves enemies even out of
the dust; the consciousness of your wickedness blunts the edge of your
swords, and adds new life and vigour to those whom your courage and
generosity had almost vanquishâ€™d before. Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, my
worthy companion of arms, refused two millions of ducats, and burnt the
merchants ships at <i>Port Royal</i>, because that was his errand, and he was
as just as he was brave. Had you two but commanded there (gentlemen) the
<i>Spanish</i> merchants had not need have made so large an offer: half the
money and ten young nuns a-piece, and you had betrayâ€™d your country.
However, we question not but in a little time, or by the next packet at
least, to hear that justice is executed upon you both to absolve the
nation, and atone for so abominable and unpardonable, so nefarious and
ungentlemen-like an action. You will find a place on the other side of
our river, that will cool your courage, by way of antiperistasis, with
wondâ€™rous heat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

Why this <i>mal au cÅ“ur</i>? You might have fancied yourself invincible, you
might have got a sanctified pass from his holiness, it would still have
had the same catastrophe. The <i>English</i> are hereticks, man, they value
none of these evangelical charms of a rush; their bullets have no
consideration in the world for a relique, nor their small-shot for a
chaplet. Besides, they are so well acquainted with our seas, their own
channel is hardly more familiar to them. This is but the old grudge of
88, when queen <i>Elizabeth</i> thumpâ€™d us so about: considering all things,
I think you are come off very well. What signifies a few paultry hulks?
The plate we are sure you had prudently carried over the mountains in
1500 carts at least, an undertaking as little dreamâ€™d of, and as much
surprizing, as prince <i>Eugene</i>â€™s passing the <i>Alps</i>; but with this
plaguy unlucky disadvantage, that it may not be quite so true. Now and
then in my more reserved speculations, I stumbled upon that same
<i>Drake</i>, that burnâ€™d about 100 of our ships at <i>Cadiz</i>; upon my honour I
canâ€™t forgive him, and yet canâ€™t blame him neither. But those two
galeons that were so richly laden, stick in my stomach most
confoundedly. No wonder our affairs prosper no better, for those same
hereticks have taken away several of our saints; that same <i>Drake</i> I
mentioned just now, he run away with <i>St. Philip</i>. Besides this, these
<i>English</i> water-dogs swam after us into <i>Cadiz</i>, and went to <i>Pointal</i>,
and there firkâ€™d us so about the pig-market, that we were even glad to
save our bacon, and fire some of our ships, and run the others on
ground; there too, after burning the admiral, these unsanctifyed ranters
stole away, not sneakingly, but with an open hand, and main force, two
most glorious saints more, St. <i>Matthew</i> and St. <i>Andrew</i>. There was
another too of those <i>English</i> bully-rocks, Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, with
a pox to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_171">{171}</a></span> him, he servâ€™d us a slippery trick indeed, for he took away
the mother of God, and God knows she was worth one hundred and fifty
thousand pounds sterling, not reckoning the other smaller craft that
went with him only to bear her company. There is something in our
destinies that gives them an ascendant over us; and a brave man scorns
to buckle to fortune. You may live to be beaten again as I was, and poor
<i>Alphonso de Leva</i>, nay, honest <i>Recalde</i>, he was cursedly maulâ€™d too
with his rear squadron; and to add to my misfortunes, I was a little
while after drubbâ€™d again by them, I thought they never would have done
dancing round me for my part: but what consummated my disgrace, and
still leaves the deepest impression on my spirits, is the burning my
fleet at <i>Calais</i>; there I must own it sincerely to you, I was somewhat
astonished: I thought <i>Vesuvius</i> had been floating upon the water, or
mount <i>Ã†tna</i> had out of kindness come to light me throâ€™ the north
passage home: but this was a hellish invention of those <i>Englishmen</i> to
set my ships on fire, and destroy us all.</p>

<p>Now this similitude of our destinies having endeared you to me, I
thought my comparing our notes together might mitigate part of your
affliction. Nay, thus far we are again alike in the frowns of insulting
fortune, that they will make new medals with the old inscription, <i>dux
fÅ“mina facti</i>. Indeed you must give me leave, Sir, to be a little free
with you, that is, to tell you for ought I know, providence may have
ordered it so, to shew that the wisdom of man is really but a chimera,
and as <i>Spain</i>, when in the highest exaltation of its glory, with a vast
fleet that was three years equipping, and consisted of no less than 130
sail of ships, enough to have forcâ€™d her way throâ€™ the universe; yet
with all this preparation, a single woman, embroilâ€™d in her state at
home, not only made head against us, but even quite destroyâ€™d us;
insomuch, that the kingdom of <i>Spain</i> was never fully able to recover
the vast expence of this fleet, and the continued losses that attended
its being beaten: in like manner, Sir, what know we but that the kingdom
of <i>France</i>, being now even at the summit of glory, and by the accession
of the <i>Spanish</i> interest, so entirely at his own devotion, may not see
all his laurels torn from his brows by a queen, and to the dishonour of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_172">{172}</a></span>
the <i>Salic</i> law, make the greatest of all its monarchs truckle to a
woman, whom they thought incapable of reigning. I donâ€™t say this will be
certainly so, but examining all occurrences hitherto, it looks but
scurvily upon the <i>Spanish</i> and <i>French</i> side. For <i>France</i> was never so
many times, and so considerably defeated since he sat upon the throne,
and that too both by sea and land. Indeed the <i>English</i> in these parts
grow very pragmatical upon it, and at every turn call for <i>a son of a
whore of a</i> Spaniard <i>to make snuff of</i>. Cardinal <i>Granvil</i>, that was
the ablest head-piece of his time, avers it so positively, that I dare
not aim at a contradiction; and his opinion is, That the <i>English</i>, who
are naturally good when they are yielded to, and only obstinate and
angry when they are opposâ€™d, will ever be happily governed by a queen;
and he assigns this for a reason, that the monarchy of <i>England</i> having
a great alloy of a republick, they are more jealous of their warlike
princes than of their weak ones, and least they should happen to give a
daring prince an unhappy opportunity of treading upon their necks, if
they should stoop any thing low, they will always in parliament keep him
at some distance; but as a woman cannot pretend to guide the reins of
empire by a strong hand, they must do it by a wise head; therefore not
trusting so much to her own judgment, as hot-headed man does, she does
nothing without the advice of her council; and that is a small
parliament, as a parliament is a grand national council, and this method
of government suits best with the <i>English</i> temper: from whence I
conclude, that <i>England</i> never was in so fair a prospect of doing
herself justice, and asserting her rights, since that miracle of a woman
queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, as it is at this juncture. For so glorious and
triumphant beginnings open all her subjects hearts, and their coffers
with them, which cannot tend but to our ruin and shame. Make haste
hither, and get out of the confusion that you cannot long defer.</p>

<p class="nind"><i><span class="letra">N</span>AY, this is beyond the possibility of patience! and thoâ€™ there is much
due to the character of princes, yet there is more to ourselves and
truth; and I cannot without<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_173">{173}</a></span> the highest injustice and ingratitude
possible, but remind you of some of the actions of your idol monarch,
which with so much reason dispute with each other, which was the most
enormous and tyrannical. I only endeavourâ€™d to make</i> Julian <i>the
apostate, pass upon posterity for a hero, and you call me an insolent
brazen-facâ€™d rascally flatterer. If I exceeded the exactness of an
historian, it was because in that treatise I set up for a courtier, and
sincerity in such people is of the most dangerous consequence
imaginable. If the emperor</i> Julian <i>had been the first monster in
nature, that met with a willing pen to set his actions in a less
inglorious light than others expected, and naked truth required; yet I
am sure he is not the greatest. Your master has tracâ€™d all the footsteps
of his cruelty and policy; for if he managâ€™d matters so swimmingly
between the catholicks and</i> Arrians, <i>that he securâ€™d himself by their
divisions</i>, LoÃ¼is <i>has all along done the same: if he countenanced the</i>
Jews, LoÃ¼is <i>supported the</i> Turks, <i>if he destroyed the christians</i>,
LoÃ¼is <i>had done it in a much more barbarous and perfidious manner. If he
threw down the images of</i> Christ <i>at</i> CÃ¦sarea Philippi, LoÃ¼is <i>has acted
the same in the front of the jesuits</i><a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Church: <i>now since you have
darâ€™d to consecrate the reputation of your king, why so many bitter
invectives against me a petty</i> Pagan, <i>for speaking in favour of my
master? you modern wits, that value your selves so much upon the having
refinâ€™d our dross, have sunk as scandalously low in matters of flattery
as any of us. We are continually pestered here with disputes; and every
court rings with the different claims. The</i> popes <i>send</i> legates <i>hither
for their saints</i>, Pluto <i>wonâ€™t let one of them go, because they are
damned. Others will have it that their time is fulfilled in Purgatory,
therefore would be discharged: but the Devil knows better things,
Father</i> Garnet <i>too, that execrable engine of the</i> Powder-Plot <i>storms
and raves, but the horned gentlemen with cloven feet laugh at him, and
his canonization. Where was there ever so much innocent christian blood
shed as on</i> Bartholo<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">{174}</a></span>mew<i>â€™s day at</i> Paris? <i>and yet even that
unparalleled murder has been justified a thousand times by your church;
as if the accurateness of a manâ€™s pen could make that pass for a virtue
which will be an everlasting and detestable blot</i>. Pelisson <i>is a man of
prodigious parts</i>, Boileau <i>the smoothest pen and noblest genius of his
time, because their prince is alive, and equally generous to reward
their flattery, as greedy to have it: but poor I, because I have been
dead one thousand four hundred years, and better, I am an idle rascally
fellow. But even at this distance I am no stranger to the transactions
of</i> Versailles; <i>and since you have spit out so much of your blackest
venom against me and my hero, I shall take the freedom to call to mind
some of those very remarkable particulars which give so glorious a
lustre, as you call it, to your</i> viro immortali. <i>His life has been one
continued series of rapines and murders, perjuries and desolations. For
thoâ€™ the first disorders in</i> Hungary, <i>were in some measure owing to the
injustices count</i> Teckeley <i>received from the ministers of the empire,
yet it is undeniably true, that</i> France <i>fomented the war, and
sollicited the</i> Turk <i>to espouse</i> Teckeley<i>â€™s quarrels, and promised to
assist him himself. The negotiations of the</i> French <i>ambassadors at the
Port, the vast sums of money remitted to</i> Teckeley, <i>and the endeavours
to disengage the king of</i> Poland <i>and the duke of</i> Bavaria <i>from the
interest of the empire; these things, Mons.</i> Boileau, <i>were not managed
with so much secrecy, but the more essential particulars are come to
many peoples knowledge. His other underhand dealings with several
princes and cities of</i> Germany, <i>shewed his formidable army in</i> Alsatia
<i>was not to succour the empire, but to seize on it. But the raising the
siege at</i> Vienna <i>broke all their measures at</i> Versailles, <i>and the king
of</i> France, <i>confounded at his disappointment, vented his rage upon his
own subjects, and that part of them too that set the crown upon his
head, when the most considerable of the</i> Roman Catholicks <i>abandonâ€™d his
interest. The ravage he committed in the territories of the three
ecclesiastical electors, and in the</i> Palatinate <i>at the same time,
shewed him rather the scourge of mankind, than the eldest son of the
church</i>.</p>

<p><i>â€™Tis true, there never was any prince but had his flatterers: but you</i>
French <i>have been guilty of the grossest to the present king of</i> France,
<i>that ever were recorded. My</i> Ju<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_175">{175}</a></span>lian <i>would have blushâ€™d, or rather
trembled, at such blasphemous adulation</i>. LoÃ¼is <i>has been adored for his
mercy, and yet exceeded our</i> Nero <i>in barbarity and bloodshed. Fire and
sword were mild executioners of his cruelty; for his impetuous lust of
mischief has been so fruitful in inventing torments, that he has made
all those forms of death desirable to his subjects that were the
reproach of tyrants: his ingenious malice has contrived exquisite pain,
without destroying the persons that suffer it; and if he could compel
man to be immortal, he would vie miseries with hell itself. He scorns
all the humble paths of</i> Domitian<i>â€™s perfidiousness: such puny perjuries
are too mean for</i> LoÃ¼is le Grand: <i>And since he could not possibly make
them greater in their nature, he aggravated them by their number. The
peace of the</i> Pyreneans, <i>that of</i> Aix la Chapelle, <i>that of</i> Nimeguen,
<i>the truce for twenty years, the edict of</i> Nants, <i>the treaty at</i>
Reswick, <i>are sufficient arguments, that he only promised that he might
not perform; and vowâ€™d to observe treaties that he might have the
lechery of breaking them afterwards with a more execrable guilt. Your
servile flattery stiles him the restorer and preserver of the peace of</i>
Christendom, <i>yet he armâ€™d the Crescent against the Cross, and carried
desolation through every corner of</i> Europe. <i>There is no prince but he
has invaded, no neighbour that he has not oppressâ€™d, no law that he has
not violated, no religion that he has not trampled on, and shewed the
successors of St.</i> Peter, <i>that he had one sword sharper than both
theirs. His panegyrists have refined the impious wit of</i> Commodus<i>â€™s
sycophants; and lest books should not transmit their blasphemies low
enough to posterity, they have raised superb monuments of his arrogancy
and their own shame. What statues, what pictures of him at</i> Versailles,
Fountainbleau, Marly, <i>the</i> Louvre, <i>the</i> Invalides, Paris <i>gates, the</i>
Palace Royal, <i>&amp;c. Where have I, Mons.</i> Boileau, <i>armâ€™d my</i> Julian <i>with
a <a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> thunderbolt? have I any thing equal to your</i> viro immortali, <i>to
your</i> divo Ludivico? <i>Why then am I such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_176">{176}</a></span> infamous flatterer, such a
sneaking cringing rascal? I have nothing comparable to your fustian
bombast, nor to the hyperboles of</i> Pelisson, <i>nor the impertinent titles
of every</i> Frenchman <i>that sets pen to paper. I leave the world to judge,
if my hero has not a juster claim to all the eulogies I have given him,
ten thousand times preferable to</i> LoÃ¼is le Grand, <i>and yet you have said

<p><i>Charming</i> Dilliana,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> SHALL not blush to own I have been in love, since the wisest men that
ever were yet, have found their philosophy too weak to prevent the
tyranny of the blind boy. However, though they were sensible of the
powers of beauty, yet they were all ignorant of its cause. The painter
that first drew <i>Cupid</i> with a fillet over his eyes, did not mean that
he was blind; but that it was impossible to express their various
motions: sometimes eager desire adds new darts to their sparkling rages:
sometimes chilling fear in a minute overcasts their glittering beams;
joy drowns â€™em in an unusual moisture, and irresolution gives â€™em a
gentle trembling despair, sinks â€™em into their orbits: jealousy
re-ascends the expiring flame: and one kind look from the person we
adore, sweetly sooths â€™em up again; and it is easy to remark from their
sudden composedness the new calm and tranquillity of the mind. We may
say as much of love as of beauty, we all knew there is such<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_177">{177}</a></span> a thing,
but none of us can tell what it is; â€™tis not youth alone that is exposâ€™d
to the fatal tempest of this raging passion: age itself has yielded to
its attacks; and we have seen some look gaily in their love, thoâ€™ they
were stepping into their graves. It laughs at the most ambitious man,
and makes a monarch turn vassal to his own subjects: it makes the miser
lavish of his adorâ€™d dust and the hoarded ore profusely scatterâ€™d at his
charmerâ€™s feet: nay, the poets themselves did not feign <i>Cupid</i> so
extravagant, as many philosophers felt him: however, love is the great
springhead from whence all our felicities flow; and our condition would
be worse than that of the very beasts, if it were exempted from this
darling passion: yet it is as true too, that there is nothing upon the
earth so enormous and detestable, but love has been the occasion of it
at one time or other. That glorious emanation of divinity, the breath of
life which gave us the similitude of our Creator, is often stifled by
this raging passion, reason revolts, and joining partly with love,
proves our ruin, by justifying a thousand absurdities: and there is no
misery to which mankind may be said to be subject to, that is not caused
by love. There would be no sorrow, no fear, no desire, no despair, no
jealousy, no hatred, if there were no love. The soul becomes a restless
sea whose tumultuous waves are continually foaming, every sense is an
inlet to this violent passion: and there are but few objects which can
affect the soul, that do not give it birth: as heat produces some things
and destroys others, so love, not unlike it, is the origin of good and
evil. It may be callâ€™d the school of honour and virtue; and yet not
improperly a theatre of horror and confusion too.</p>

<p>â€™Tis the powerful and pleasing band of human society; without it there
would be no families, no kingdoms; and yet we read of an <i>Alexander</i>
that sacrificâ€™d a whole city to a smile of a mistress. <i>Anthony</i>
disputed the world with <i>CÃ¦sar</i>, yet chose rather to lose it than be
absent from <i>Cleopatra</i>â€™s arms. <i>David</i> forgot the august character of a
man after Godâ€™s own heart, and though so famous for prowess as well as
piety, basely murtherâ€™d the injurâ€™d <i>Uriah</i>, the more freely to enjoy
the lovely adulteress. Charming <i>Sempronia</i>, the fire is pure in itself,
â€™tis the matter only that sends up all those offensive clouds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">{178}</a></span> smoak;
and if nature were not depraved, love would not cause these disorders:
â€™twouâ€™d not mix poyson with wine to destroy a rival, and throâ€™ a sea of
blood and tears wade to its object. Love is the most formidable enemy a
wise man can have, and is the only passion against which he has no
defence. If anger surprise him, it lasts not long, and the same minute
concludes it as commencâ€™d it: If by a slower fire his choler boils, he
prevents its running over; but love steals so secretly, and so sweetly
withal; into every corner of our hearts, into every faculty of the soul,
that it is absolutely master before we can perceive it. When once we
discover it, we are quite undone: at the same time he triumphs over our
wisdom, and our reason too, and makes them both his vassals to maintain
his tyranny: what else could mean those numerous follies of the
adulterous gods descending in viler forms to commit their rapes?&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>The first wound that beauty makes is almost insensible, and though the
deadly poison spreads through every part; we hardly suspect we are in
danger. At first indeed we are only pleasâ€™d with seeing the person or
talking of â€™em, affecting an humble complaisance for all they say, or
do, the very thinking on them is charming; and the desires we have as
yet, are so far from impetuosity, that no philosopher could be so rigid
as to condemn us.</p>

<p>Hitherto â€™tis well, but â€™tis hardly love, for that like a bee, forfeits
its name if it has no sting. But alas! the lurking fire quickly bursts
out, and that pleasing idea which represented itself so sweetly and so
respectfully to the soul one moment before, now insolently obtrudes upon
our most serious thoughts, and makes us impious even at the horns of the
altar; she perfidiously betrays us in our very sleep itself, sometimes
appearing haughty and scornfully, sometimes yielding and kind; and this
too when there is no reason for either. The infant-passion is now become
a cruel father of all other passions; cruel indeed, for he has no sooner
given birth to one, but he stifles it to introduce another; whose
short-livâ€™d fate is just the same, and destroyâ€™d the next moment it is
born.</p>

<p>Hope and despair, joy and sorrow, courage and fear, continually succeed
each other; anger, jealousy, and revenge, distract the mind; and all
these mingled, their fu<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_179">{179}</a></span>ry is like a storm blowing from every corner of
the heavens: then the lover, like the ocean, agitated by such boisterous
winds, he foams and roars, the swelling waves of his boiling appetite
dash each other to pieces, the foggy clouds of melancholy and
disappointment intercept the glittering rays of reasonâ€™s sun; the
rattling thunder of jealous rage breaks throâ€™ his trembling sphere, when
his understanding returns but for a moment, â€™tis like darted lightning
piercing throâ€™ the obscure of violent passions, and shews nature in
every lover a confusion almost equal to her original chaos.</p>

<p>Whoever was really in love (<i>charming Sempronia</i>) will readily confess
the allegory to be just. Thoâ€™ nothing has surprised me more in affairs
of this nature than that most men who have been sensible of this passion
do not care to own it, when once their more indulgent fate has put a
period to it; as if it were a calling their judgment in question to
believe they thought a woman handsom. Your eyes justify our adoration,
and will ever constitute the felicity of</p>

with lubberliness, to sot away your time in <i>Mongo</i>â€™s fumitory, among a
parcel of old smoak-dryâ€™d cadators, and not so much since my departure,
as cut a link-boy over the pate, pink a hackney-coachman, or draw your
sword upon a cripple, to fill the town with new rumours of your wonted
bravery, and make the callow students of the wrangling society wag their
unfledgâ€™d chins over their pennyworths of <i>Ninny Broth</i>? adds
fleshly-wounds, in what sheeps-head ordinary have you chewâ€™d away the
meridian altitude of your tygerantick stomach? and where squanderâ€™d away
the tiresom minutes of your evening-leisure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_180">{180}</a></span> over sealâ€™d <i>Winchesters</i>
of three-penny guzzle: that in all this time you have never exerted your
hectorian talent, but keep your reputation mustying upon an old
foundation, which is ready to sink, for want of being repairâ€™d by some
new notable atchievements.</p>

<p>Do you think the obsolete renown of cutting off a knightâ€™s thumb in a
duel, and keeping onâ€™t in your pocket three weeks for a tobacco-stopper;
lying with the <i>French</i> king in your travels, and kicking him out of bed
for farting in his sleep; answering the challenge of a life-guardman for
tearing a hole in his stocking with the chape of your sword when his
jack-boots were on; gone where honour calls, behind <i>Southampton</i> walls:
return by five, if alive, <i>Hen. W&#8212;&#8212;n</i>. disarming three highwaymen
upon the road with two-pence half-penny in your pocket, and letting them
go upon their parole of honour; wearing a wig for ten years together
without losing the curl or combing out one hair; taking a tyger by the
tooth; and the <i>Grand seignior</i> by his whiskers; bearing an ensign in a
mimick fight upon your atlantick shoulders; knocking a shiting porter
down, when you were drunk, backwards into his own sir-reverence; your
duel with <i>Johannes in nubibus</i>, in behalf of a lady you never set eyes
on; your eating five shillings-worth of meat at a nine-penny ordinary,
and at last treated by the man of the house to have no more of your
custom; do you think these, or a hundred like antiquated exploits are
sufficient to maintain the character of a stanch bully without new
enterprizes? no, an old reputation is like an old house, which if not
repaired often, must quickly fall of necessity to decay and will at
last, by little, for want of new application, be totally obliterated.</p>

<p>Therefore, if ever you intend to be my rival in glory, you must fright a
bailiff once a day, stand kick and cuff once a week, challenge some
coward or other once a month, bilk your lodging once a quarter, and
cheat a taylor once a year, crow over every coxcomb you meet with, and
be sure you kick every jilt you bully into an open-leggâ€™d submission and
a compliance of treating you; never till then will the fame of <i>W&#8212;&#8212;n</i>

<p>To let you know I am not like a cock or a bull-dog to lose my courage
when I change my climate, I shall proceed to give you a very modest
account of some of my bold undertakings in these diabolical confines,
these damnâ€™d dusky unsavory grottos, where althoâ€™ there are whole rivers
of brimstone for the convenient dipping of card-matches, yet if a man
would give one ounce of immortality for so much of a rush-candle, â€™tis
as hard to be purchasâ€™d upon the faith of a christian, as if you were to
buy honey of a bear, or a stallion of a lascivious duchess, that wants
frication more than she does money; so that at my first entrance into
this damnâ€™d dark cavern, I staggerâ€™d about by guess, like some drunken
son of a whore tumbled into a <i>Newcastle</i> cole-pit; and finding myself
in this ugly condition, I could not forbear breathing a few curses out
upon the place, which, by the lord of the territories, were thrown away
as much in vain, as if I had carried lice to <i>Newgate</i>, or wishâ€™d the
people mad in <i>Bedlam</i>: as I thus blunderâ€™d about like a beetle in a
hollow tree, I happenâ€™d to break my shins against a confounded poker,
upon which I made a damnable swearing for a light, that I might see
whereabouts I was, but to no purpose; I found I might as well have
callâ€™d upon <i>Jupiter</i> to have lent me his hand to have draggâ€™d me out of
<i>Pluto</i>â€™s dominions. This sort of stumbling entertainment so provokâ€™d my
patience, that thoâ€™ I knew I was under the devilâ€™s jurisdiction, yet I
could not tell, but like a debtor in a prison, or bully in a
bawdy-house, I might fare the better for mutinying, so that I dischargâ€™d
such a volley of new-coinâ€™d oaths, and made such damnâ€™d roaring and
raving, that the devils began to fear I should put hell in an uproar;
upon this a couple of tatterdemalion hobgobblings, that lookâ€™d like a
brace of scare-crows just flown out of a pease-field, seizâ€™d me by the
shoulders and run me into the bilboes; confound you, said I, for a
couple of hell-cats, whatâ€™s this for? For, crys one of the grim
potentates, as saucily as a reforming constable, for your tumultuous
noisy behaviour, why sure, you donâ€™t think you are got into a
bear-garden. Wounds, quoth I, thou talkâ€™st as if the devil kept a
conventicle; why hell at this rate is worse than a parliament-house, if
a man maynâ€™t have the liberty of speech, especially when â€™tis to redress
his grievances.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">{182}</a></span></p>

<p>Just as we were thus parlying, who should come by, but <i>Bob Weden</i>,
jabbering to him self like a jack-daw in a cherry-tree that had lost his
mate, I knew him by his hoarse voice, which sounded like the lowest note
of a double courtel: whoâ€™s there, <i>Bob</i>, said I? Captain, says he, I am
heartily glad to see you; yes, yes, I am that very drone of a bag-pipe,
you may know me by my hum; I have got my <i>quietus</i> at last, and I thank
my stars, by the help of rum and hot weather, have bilkâ€™d all my
<i>English</i> creditors. Why where the devil, said I, did you die then, that
you give your creditors, the epithet of <i>English</i>? just over our head,
says he, in that damnâ€™d country <i>Barbadoes</i>, where my brains usâ€™d to
boil by the heat of the sun like a hasty-pudding in a sauce-pan; have
been in a sweat ever since above seven months before I died; all the
while I livâ€™d in that damnâ€™d treacly colony, I fancied myself to be just
like a live grig tossâ€™d into a frying-pan; and now death, pox on him for
a raw-head and bloody-bones, has tossâ€™d me out of the frying-pan into
the fire. Indeed, <i>Bob</i>, said I, I could wish myself in an ice-house
heartily, for I have been in a kind of hectic fever ever since my
admittance. Zounds, says he, â€™tis so hot thereâ€™s no enduring onâ€™t; its a
country fit for nothing but a salamander to live in; if <i>Abednego</i>â€™s
oven had been but half so hot, if any of them had come out without
singing their garments, Iâ€™d have forsworn brandy to all eternity. Well
but, prithee captain, how came your pedestals to be in this jeopardy? I
told him the truth thoâ€™ I was in a damnâ€™d lying country, only for
cursing and swearing a little. Oh! says he, you must have a great care
of that for here are a parcel of whiggish devils lately climbâ€™d into
authority, who thoâ€™ they were the forwardest of all the infernal host,
in the rebellion against heaven, yet of late they pretend to such
demurity as to form a society for the <i>Regulation of Manners</i>, thoâ€™
themselves are a parcel of the wickedest spirits in all hellâ€™s
dominions; but however, have a little patience, I have a justice of
peace hard by of my acquaintance, who thoâ€™ he be one of their kidney as
to matter of religion, yet I know heâ€™ll be as drunk with burnâ€™d brandy
as a sow with hogwash; will bugger a <i>Succubus</i> when his lustâ€™s
predominant; and as for cursing and swearing, heâ€™s more expert at it
than a losing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_183">{183}</a></span> gamester, and if I meet him in a merry humour, I donâ€™t
doubt but to prevail.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Bob</i> left me for a few moments, and indeed had we been in a
brandy-shop where we had had any thing to have paid, I should have much
questionâ€™d his return; but being in a strange country, where friends are
always glad to meet one another, and being free from the predicament of
a reckoning, I had some hopes of his being as good as his word, which in
the other world all his acquaintance knew as well as my self, he was
never over careful to preserve.</p>

<p>During his absence, I had little else to do but to curse the country,
and scratch my ears for want of liberty, which were terrified with the
buzzing of a parcel of fanatical souls, who swarmâ€™d as thick as bees at
a <i>Hampshire</i>-farmers, some damning of doctor <i>B&#8212;&#8212;ges</i>, others
confounding of <i>Timothy Cr&#8212;soe</i>, some raving against <i>Me&#8212;d</i> of
<i>Stepney</i>, others cursing of <i>Salters-Hall</i>, &amp;c. as if the ready road to
hell was to travel through <i>Presbytery</i>.</p>

<p>By this time my friend <i>Bob</i> was as good as his word, which was the
first time I ever knew him so. Well, says he, you may see I am as sure
as a <i>Robin</i>, I have got your discharge; but the justice swears, had you
been confinâ€™d for any thing besides whoring, drinking, and swearing, you
should have been shackled and been damnâ€™d before heâ€™d ever have releasâ€™d
you; but however hereâ€™s a little <i>Scribere cum dasho</i> will set you at
liberty; upon which we callâ€™d the constable of the ward, who, upon sight
of the discharge, freed my supporters from confinement, which was no
sooner done, but with a reciprocal joy for my happy deliverance, we
began a ramble together throâ€™ all the neighbouring avenues, in hopes to
meet with something that might give us a little diversion; we had not
travelled above an hundred yards, but who should we meet but the old
snarling rogue that usâ€™d to cry <i>poor Jack</i>, with his wife after him; he
no sooner espyâ€™d us, but attackâ€™d us open-mouthâ€™d after the following
manner, <i>Two sharpers without one penny of money in their pockets; a
couple of bullies, and both cowards, ha, ha. Now for a fool with a full
pocket, a good dinner on free-cost, a whore and a tavern, a belly-full
of wine without paying forâ€™t, ha, ha, ha, a hackney-coach for a bilk, or
a brass-shilling, a long sword,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_184">{184}</a></span> never a shirt</i>, White-Fryars <i>iâ€™thâ€™ day
time, a garret at night, ha, ha, ha, ha</i>. Thus the old rascal run upon
us as we passâ€™d by him, that we were both as glad when we were out of
his reach, as a hen-peckâ€™d cuckold that has shunnâ€™d the hisses of that
serpent he hugs every night in his bosom.</p>

<p>We had not gone twenty yards farther, scarce out of the reach of the
noisy tongue of this railing peripatetick, but we met <i>Bowman</i> that kept
the <i>Dog-tavern</i> in <i>Drury-lane</i>, whose first salutation was, <i>Pox take
you both for a couple of shammocking rascals, if it had not been for you
and such others of your company, I had been a living man to this day,
for you broke my tavern and that broke my heart. When I went off,
besides book-debts never paid, but crossâ€™d out and forgiven, I had as
much chalk scored up in my bar, upon your account, as would have
whitened the flesh of twenty calves at</i> Rumford, <i>or have cured half the
town of the heart-burn, that never were satisfied to this day, and as
certainly as you are both damnâ€™d, I would arrest you here in the</i>
Devilâ€™<i>s name, but that ye know a foreign plea, or the statute of
limitation are pleadable in defiance of me; and that whore my wife too,
that used to open her sluice and let in an inundation of shabroons to
gratify her concupiscence, she lent her helping buttock among ye to
shove on my ruin; but if ever I catch the strumpet in these territories,
Iâ€™ll sear up the bung-hole of her filthy firkin, but Iâ€™ll reward her for
her bitching</i>. <i>Confound you, cries</i> Bob, <i>for a cuckoldy cydermonger;
do not you know damnation pays every manâ€™s scores, and thoâ€™ we tickâ€™d in
the other world for subsistence, it was not with a design to cheat you
or any body else, for we knew we should have the Devil to pay one time
or other, and now you see, like honest men, we have pawned our souls for
the whole reckoning, and so a fart for our creditors; you see we had
rather be damnâ€™d than not to make general satisfaction, and yet you are
not satisfied. Why a man at this rate had better live in</i> Newgate <i>to
eternity, than be thus plagued with creditors after his arse, to put him
in mind of old scores wherever he travels; besides, â€™tis against the law
of humanity, for a man to be dunnâ€™d for a domestick debt in a foreign
country. Well, gentlemen</i>, says he, <i>I find you have not forgot your old
principles; and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_185">{185}</a></span> good by to ye</i>. And thus, as <i>old Nic</i> would have
it, we got rid of our second plague.</p>

<p>As we went from thence, turning down into a steep narrow lane,
irregularly pavâ€™d with rugged flints, like the bottom of a mountain in
<i>North-Wales</i>, a damnâ€™d greasy great fellow, with his hair thrust under
a dirty night-cap, in a dimity-wastcoat and buff-breeches, with a hugh
bucks-horn-handle-knife hanging by a silver-chain at his apron-strings,
came puffing and blowing up the hill against us, like a <i>crampus</i> before
a storm, sweating as if he had been doing the drudgery of <i>Sisyphus</i>,
and coming near us he makes a halt, and looking me full in my face,
gives a mannerly bow, and cries, <i>Your servant noble captain: Friend</i>,
said I, <i>I donâ€™t know thee. Ah! master</i>, said he, <i>time was, when you
condescended to eat many a sop in the pan in my poor kitchin; I kept the
sign of the gridiron in</i> Waterlane <i>for many years together, but have
been damnâ€™d, the lord help me, above these nine months, for only
cozening my customers with slink veal</i>. I told him I was sorry for his
condition, and hopâ€™d I did not owe him any thing: <i>No, worthy master</i>,
says he, <i>not a farthing, for you never had more at a meal than a
half-penny rowl, and I always, because you were a gentleman, allowâ€™d you
the benefit of my dripping-pan, and every time you came, you paid me for
my bread very honestly</i>. I did not much approve of the rogueâ€™s memory,
so bid him farewel: but my friend <i>Weden</i>, like a bantering dog, did so
terrify my ears about my half-penny ordinary, that I had rather for the
time been flung naked into a tuft of nettles.</p>

<p>As he was thus teazing me, who should we stumble upon but captain
<i>Swinny</i> the <i>Irishman</i>; you cannot but imagine a very joyful
congratulation passâ€™d between us: who had been stanch friends, such old
and intimate acquaintance. No sooner was our salutation over, but we
began to enquire as we usâ€™d to do upon earth, into one anotherâ€™s
circumstances: upon which, says <i>Swinny, By my soul and shalvation, I
have got my good old lord here, that I usâ€™d to procure and pimp for in
tâ€™other world; and as he gave me money upon earth to indulge him in his
sins, and provide him whores to cool his lechery, now heâ€™s damnâ€™d forâ€™t,
like a grateful master, he allows me every day a dish of snapdragons to
fetch him water from</i> Styx, <i>to cool his entrails</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_186">{186}</a></span> I think, says
<i>Bob</i>, you were always very careful of your lordâ€™s health, and never
brought any thing to his embraces but unpenetrated maids, or very sound
thorn-backs. <i>By chriesh and shaint Patrick, â€™tis very true</i>, says he,
<i>for I always made my self his taster for fear he should be poisonâ€™d,
and first took a sip of the cup to try whether the juice was good or no;
and thoâ€™ he was as great a wencher as any was in</i> England, <i>Iâ€™ll take my
swear, excepting the gout, heâ€™s come as sound a nobleman into hell, as
has took leave of the other world these fifty years, and was so very
bobborous two days ago, thoâ€™ heâ€™s near seventy, that he bid me look out
for soft-handed she-devil to give him a little frication, and said
nothing vexâ€™d him but that he was damnâ€™d among a parcel of spirits, with
whom he could have no carnal copulation: well, gentlemen, I must loiter
no longer, I am travelling in haste to</i> Styx <i>to fill my lordâ€™s bottle,
but all wonâ€™t cool his lechery, thoâ€™ he be turnâ€™d a perfect aquapote so,
my dear joys, farewel</i>.</p>

<p>We had not parted with him as many minutes a man may beget his likeness
in, but who should we meet but <i>Mumford</i> the player, looking as pale as
a ghost, falling forward as gently as a catterpillar cross a
sicamore-leaf, gaping for a little air, like a sinner just come out of
the powdering tub, crying out as he crept towards us, <i>Oh my back!
confound â€™em for a pack of brimstones: Oh my back!</i> how now, Sir
<i>Courtly</i>, said I, what the devil makes thee in this pickle? Oh,
<i>gentlemen</i>, says he, I am glad to see you, but I am troubled with such
a weakness in my back, that it makes me bend like a superannuated
fornicator: some strain, said I, got in the other world with overheaving
your self. Whatâ€™s matter how â€™twas got, says he, can you tell me any
thing thatâ€™s good forâ€™t? yes, said I, get a good warm <i>Girdle</i> and tie
round you, â€™tis an excellent corroboratick to strengthen the loins; pox
on you, says he, for a bantering dog how can a single girdle do me good,
when a <i>Brace</i> was my destruction? I think, said I, you did die a martyr
for a pair of penetrable whiskers, fell a bleeding sacrifice to a cloven
tuft, that was glad, I believe, of your going out of the other world, as
old <i>Nic</i> was of your coming into this, for I hear you kept the poor
titmouse under such slavish subjection, that a peer of the realm,
notwithstanding his honour, could not so much as come in to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_187">{187}</a></span>
brother-starling with you. Nay, some say you put an <i>Italian</i> security
uponâ€™t, purposely to indict any body for felony and burglary that should
break open the lock. Pox confound you, says he, for a lyar, how can that
be, when half the pit knows they had egress and regress when they
pleasâ€™d without any manner of obstruction? but tattling here wonâ€™t do my
business, I must seek out <i>Needham</i>, <i>Lower</i>, or some other famous
physician that may give me ease; so gentlemen, adieu to ye.</p>

<p>We had not gone much farther, but at the corner of a dirty lane we found
a wondrous throng of attentive scoundrels, serenaded by a couple of
ballad-singers, who stood in the middle of the tatterâ€™d audience, with
their hands under their ears, singing, <i>With a rub, rub, rub, rub, rub,
rub, in and out, in and out ho</i>: who should come limping by just in the
interim, but Mr. <i>Dryden</i> the poet: thereâ€™s a delicious song for you,
gentlemen, says he, there are luscious words wrapt up in clean linen for
you; thoâ€™ there is a very bawdy mystery in them, yet they are so
intelligibly expressâ€™d, that a girl of ten years old may understand the
meaning of them; my lord <i>Rochester</i>â€™s songs are mine arse to it: well
my dear <i>Love for Love</i>, thou deservest to be poet laureat, were it only
for the composure of this seraphick ditty, â€™tis enough to put musick
into the tail of an old woman of fourscore, and make a girl of fourteen
to be as knowing in her own thoughts, as her parents that got her; oh,
â€™tis a song of wonderful instruction, of incomparable modesty,
considering its meaning. Who should come puffing into the crowd in
abundance of haste, with a face as red as a new pantile, but <i>Nat Lee</i>?
Hark you, <i>Nat</i>, says <i>Dryden</i>, did you ever here such a feeling ballad
in your life before? egad, the words steal so cunningly into ones veins,
that nature will scarce be pacified till she has dropt some loose corns
into oneâ€™s breeches. Foh, you old lecherous beast, says <i>Nat Lee</i>,
hereâ€™s a song indeed for a poet-bays of your gravity to admire! I have
heard twenty better under <i>White-Fryars</i> gate-way. Youâ€™re a mad man,
says <i>Dryden</i>, you never understood a song in your life, nor any thing
else, but jumbling the gods about, as if they were so many tapsters in a
lumber-house. Iâ€™ll sing you a song, says <i>Lee</i>, worth fifty onâ€™t that I
made when I was in <i>Bedlam</i>, to be sung in my play, that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_188">{188}</a></span> five and
twenty acts inâ€™t; now pray observe me, and your self shall be judge.</p>

<p>Well, says Mr. <i>Lee</i>, after he had ended his ditty, what think you now,
Mr. <i>Dryden</i>? Think, says he, what should I think? I think there is more
pretty tickling sort of wit in the very <i>chorus</i> of the other, than
there is in all your piece of frantick trumpery. Thus we leave them
squabbling together, which song should have the preference, and so stept
forward.</p>

<p>We had not joggâ€™d on above a quarter of a mile further, but a parcel of
spirits in the shape of screech-owls came hovering over our heads,
crying out, <i>Make room, make room, for the chief pastor of the flock
will be here to night</i>. Think we, hereâ€™s some great guest or other a
coming; for my part I thought nothing less than an archbishop of
<i>C-n&#8212;&#8212;y</i>: my friend <i>Bob</i> was much of my opinion, and cryâ€™d, there
was some fat priest coming in to pay his garnish, but who should it
prove at last but a dissenting doctor, trickâ€™d up in a band and cloak,
and all the factious ornaments becoming a squeamish conscience, attended
with abundance of bald crowns and gray hairs, who came hobbling after
him like the old men of the <i>Charter-house</i>, behind their chaplain to
eleven a-clock prayers. My friend <i>Bob</i> and I having both a curiosity to
know what <i>Don Prattlebox</i> it was, enquirâ€™d of a devil who had a
discerning countenance, if he knew who this new comer was?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_189">{189}</a></span> He answerâ€™d
us â€™twas doctor <i>Ma&#8212;th&#8212;w T&#8212;y&#8212;r</i> of <i>Salters-hall</i>, and those that
attend him were some of his congregation, who were come in order to take
up lodgings for the rest, who would not be long after: Adsheart, says
<i>Bob</i>, they are the most faithful flock in the universe, for if their
shepherd comes to the devil, I see they will be sure to follow him,
whilst the churchmen are such a parcel of straying sheep, that thoâ€™
their guides go to heaven themselves, they can perswade but very few of
their congregation to bear them company.</p>

<p>The next person that we met with as we were rambling about, was <i>Harry
Care</i>, the whiggish pamphleteer, who was stuffâ€™d all over with papers as
thick as a buttock of beef with parsley, and coming near us, he askâ€™d
how long we had been in? Sir, said I, we are both but lately come from
the other world: pray gentlemen, says he, can you tell me how my old
friend Sir <i>Roger lâ€™Estrange</i> does, and whether you hear any thing of
his coming into these parts, for I am at a great loss for some body to
exercise my talent with? I left him very well, said I, but when he takes
leave of the upper world, whether he goes up hill or down hill to
eternity I canâ€™t inform you. Sir, says he, your humble servant; and away
he troopâ€™d and left us without further impertinence.</p>

<p>As we were passing by the door of a little brandy-shop, who should be
sitting upon an old worm-eaten bench, but <i>Sam Scott</i> the Fiddle-seller,
and <i>Will. Elder</i> the graver, each with a huge <i>Dutch</i> pipe of infernal
mundungus in their mouths smoaking for two penny-worth of
anniseed-water. <i>Sam. Scott</i> had one while got the start of him, which
<i>Will Elder</i> perceiving, exercised his lungs so very strenuously, that
he overtook him at the last whiff, which they dischargâ€™d with such
remarkable exactness, that none of the standers by could undertake to
decide the wager: when their pipes were out, we saluted one another with
abundance of friendship, and <i>Sam. Scott</i> having an ascendency over the
house, invited us to take part of a bowl of punch, and just as we were
stepping in, who should come by but <i>O&#8212;&#8212;n P&#8212;&#8212;ce</i> that dyâ€™d drunk
at the <i>Dog</i>-tavern in the company of my friend <i>Weden</i>: mighty joyful
we were to meet thus fortunately together; and to crown the happy
juncture with an hourâ€™s mirth, we stept into the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">{190}</a></span> conveniency,
every soul seating himself upon an empty rundlet like a godson of
<i>Bacchus</i>, in order to receive the promisâ€™d blessing: by that time we
had every one rammâ€™d a full charge of sot-weed into our infernal guns,
in order to fumify our immortalities, the scull of <i>Goliah</i> was brought
in for a punch-bowl fillâ€™d with such incomparable <i>Heliconian</i> juice,
that six drops of it would make a man a better poet than either
<i>Shakespear</i> or <i>Ben. Johnson</i>: by that time a cup or two were gone
about to <i>Pluto</i> and my lady <i>Proserpine</i>, we began to fall into a merry
inquisition about one anotherâ€™s damnation: prithee <i>Sam. Scott</i>, said I,
what the devil were you damnâ€™d for? why, Iâ€™ll tell you, says <i>Sam</i>. I
was found guilty of a couple of indictments, one was for consuming 975
papers of tobacco in six months, without any assistance, to the
poisoning of many a ptisicky citizen about <i>Temple-bar</i>; and the other
was smoaking my dog to death without any provocation. Come, <i>Bob
Weeden</i>, said I â€™tis your turn next, let us go round with it, prithee
what charge did the hellish informers bring against you? To tell you the
truth, says he, they provâ€™d me guilty of two great crimes too, one was
for dealing by my friends very knavishly: and the other was for living
by my wits very foolishly. Come, captain <i>Dawson</i>, says the company,
what sort of conviction are you under? as for my part, <i>gentlemen</i>, said
he, the chief thing that condemnâ€™d me, was the sin of forgetfulness;
â€™twas only for bilking my lodging, and being so careless to leave my
perriwig-come behind me. Well, neighbour <i>P&#8212;&#8212;ce</i>, said I, what was it
brought you into these territories? â€™twas for living like a rake, says
he, without money, and dying drunk in a tavern with twelve shillings in
my pocket. <i>Will. Elder</i> being the last, we summâ€™d up our enquiry with
his confession; truly says he, mine was a very great fault I must
acknowledge, no less than the damnable sin of omission: you must know,
<i>gentlemen</i>, the chief of my business was to grave the <i>Lordâ€™s-Prayer</i>
within the compass of a silver penny; but to tell you the truth, I never
thought of it but when I was at work, since my eyes were open, and â€™tis
chiefly for that neglect I suffer this confinement.</p>

<p>Well, says <i>Bob Weeden</i>, for my part, now I have got a bowl of Punch
before me, and such good company, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_191">{191}</a></span> would not give a nitt out of my
shirt-collar to return back to my old quarters upon earth, for that was
but a life full of extreams, and this can be no other; for there I was
always very drunk or very drowsy, surfeited or very hungry, generally
very poor and very pocky, afraid to walk the streets, and no money to
keep me within doors; thought very witty by fools, and by wise men very
wicked, was every bodyâ€™s jester that wanted wit, and a blockhead to all
those that had it; dunnâ€™d every where, and trusted no where; carâ€™d not
for any body, and belovâ€™d by no body: and what station on this side
death can be worse than such a miserable life? What signifies a little
hot weather, when a manâ€™s assurâ€™d it canâ€™t endanger his health; nothing
can be subject to sickness but what is liable to death, and that period,
immortality is free from. Come then said I, if it be so, hereâ€™s a bumper
in memory of the cellar at the <i>Still</i>, and honest <i>Jack Ni&#8212;&#8212;ls</i> the
harper, count <i>C&#8212;&#8212;ni&#8212;&#8212;s</i>, captain <i>Wa-k-er</i>, and all the jolly
lads of our loving acquaintance, with a huzza. In this manner we spent
the evening as merrily as so many tars under the tropicks, over their
forfeitures, till at last we had the devil to pay with empty pockets:
but <i>Sam Scott</i>, who was the undertaker of the treat, having made his
coffin into a bass-viol, gave my landlady a lesson, two or three kisses,
and a few fair words, and prevailed with her to trust him for the
reckoning; so being all saluted with youâ€™re welcome gentlemen, we all
arose like a company of coopers from our tubs and our rundlets, and went
away hooping for more liquor.</p>

<p>These are all the remarkable passages that at present I think worth
transmitting to you: so, hoping you will requite me after the like
manner with something that may be entertaining to a gentleman under my
warm circumstances; if it be an essay upon ice, or a treatise of the
sovereign efficacy of rock-water, it will be a very cooling satisfaction
to your parboilâ€™d friend,</p>

have forgiven you, than I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_193">{193}</a></span> have gone one day without a dinner if I
had but one book in my library; therefore all things shall be forgotten,
thoâ€™ you have deservâ€™d the contrary. And since you have obliged me with
a short journal of your transactions on the other side <i>Styx</i>, I think
myself obligâ€™d in honour to make a return of your civility after the
like manner, for the world knows me to be a man of a forgiving temper,
and I scorn by bearing malice, or studying revenge, to forfeit my
character.</p>

<p>I happenâ€™d the other night in company with some men of honour, brave
fellows, who were a little nice in their conversation, as well as their
wine, that tryâ€™d every word that was spoke by the touch-stone of good
manners, and one of them happening to say he was a lieutenant on board
one of his majestyâ€™s small frigats, when so violent a storm rose upon
the coast of <i>Ireland</i>, that a monumental sea washing over the topmast
head, by the very pressure of its weight sunk the vessel to the bottom
of the ocean, which gave such a prodigious knock against the sand with
her keel, that the very rebound, being a tight ship, sent her up again
to the surface, without damage; and that by a watch of <i>Tompion</i>â€™s,
which he had in his pocket, they were three quarters of an hour and some
odd minutes in this dangerous expedition, that is, in going down and
coming up again. Lord Sir, says I, how did you breathe all that while?
Zoons, Sir, says he, â€™tis an affront to ask a gentleman such a question,
and I demand satisfaction? am I bound to tell every blockhead how many
times I fetch my breath in three quarters of an hour? Nay, Sir, said I,
if you are for that sport, have at you, Iâ€™m a man of honour, and dare
wait upon you any where; with that he whisperâ€™d me to go down stairs,
which we both did accordingly, and drawing at the door, the first pass I
made was a home thrust (for I never love to dally in such cases) and I
run him throâ€™ the centre of the fifth jubilee button of his coat, and
just scratchâ€™d him in the breast, upon which he droppâ€™d his sword,
believing I had killâ€™d him; but I taking up the fallen weapon, steppâ€™d
to him and unbracâ€™d him, found he was more afraid than hurt; and that it
was but a small prick that signified nothing: Now, pray Sir, said I, how
did you breathe, I think I may make bold to ask you? Iâ€™ll tell you, Sir,
said he, I took in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">{194}</a></span> water at my mouth, just as a fish does, but
having no gills to give it vent, I let it out of my fundament. Upon
which answer, I was well satisfyâ€™d, gave him his sword, and we became as
great friends as the devil and the earl of <i>Kent</i>.</p>

<p>Another duel I had since that, (for you must know challenges come thick
and threefold upon me, like actions upon a breaking shop-keeper) which I
hope for its singularity, will prove a little entertaining to you; I
happened lately to be invited to a gentlemanâ€™s chamber in <i>Grays-Inn</i>,
to drink part of a bowl of punch; accordingly I went, and was very
plentifully entertained among some other gentlemen of my acquaintance,
with a capacious vessel of this most noble <i>Diapente</i>, insomuch, that we
were all elevated above the use of our legs, as well as our reason. The
gentleman that gave us the entertainment, by the assistance of his man,
made a shift to get to bed about twelve at night, but the rest lay up
and down in the corners of the room, snoaring like so many gorgâ€™d swine,
and battening in their own snivel, which tobacco had drainâ€™d from their
moist entrails: I guarded the garrison of good liquor the very last man,
and maintainâ€™d my post at the table like a true <i>English</i> hero, till
between <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Morpheus</i>, like the rest of my companions, I was
lullâ€™d into a lethargy, and falling forward in my chair upon the table,
my forehead happenâ€™d to take the edge of the punch bowl, and turnâ€™d it
clear over my head, that it served me for a night-cap, my nose being
drowned in the remains of the punch; every time I drew up my breath, up
went a spoonful, so that in a little time my nostrils were syringâ€™d as
clean as a ladyâ€™s honour by noon, that has drank two quarts of <i>Epsom</i>
waters for her mornings draught: but after some time being almost
suffocated, nature finding itself oppressâ€™d, gave me a jog, and wakâ€™d me
out of this drunken slumber. I had not scratchâ€™d my ears, and rubbâ€™d my
eyes above three minutes, but awakes another; O lord! says he, that a
man should lead this wicked life, to be married but a fortnight and play
these tricks, my wife will think I am a whoring already, or plague
herself with some damnâ€™d whimsy or other. By this time a third awakes,
starts up like a ghost out of a grave, crying, A little drink for the
Lordâ€™s sake, for I am</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_195">{195}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">as drowsy as if I had been dryâ€™d in an oven all night, and with that
whips up the punch-bowl to his head, and drinks off the rincings of my
nostrils as heartily as if it had been sherbet made on purpose for a
cooler, and by the way, ever since that time has found such an
alteration in his faculties, that from a very dull fellow he is become
an absolute wit, to the admiration of all that knew him, thoâ€™ I never
durst tell him it was from the dripping of my brains that he derivâ€™d his
ingenuity. But to be short in my story, when I was thoroughly awakâ€™d, I
began to have a wambling in my stomach, as if I had suppâ€™d over night
with a mountebankâ€™s toad-eater, the chamber-pot being full, I was
unwilling to defile the room, and before I was aware, let fly into my
<i>lignum-vitÃ¦</i> night-cap, and being then pretty well at ease, I openâ€™d
the chamber door, and staggerâ€™d homewards; at the end of <i>Turnstile</i> I
happenâ€™d to make a trip at a drunkardâ€™s enemy, a stump, and down I
tumbled; who should come by before I could get up again, but the
constable going his rounds, who quickly made me the centre of a circle
of jack of lanthorns, and seeing me grovelling on the ground, did not
know but some body had mischievâ€™d me, upon which they askâ€™d me if I was
wounded? Yes said I, sadly cut. Where, where, Sir, cries the watchmen? I
replyâ€™d, about the head; they cryâ€™d out, who did it, who did it! punch,
punch, said I; one of the watchmen being a fat short fellow, they usâ€™d
to call him punch, by my soul, Sir, said he to the constable, I never
saw the gentleman all the night before, and with that they haulâ€™d me up,
and perceiving their mistake, two of them, like honest fellows, handed
me home to my chambers, without so much as stealing my hat, or picking
my pockets, which was a wonder: I had not been many hours in bed, but
comes the footman of the gentleman who entertainâ€™d us, to my door with a
challenge, for affronting him for his civility, by spewing into his
punch-bowl. I sent him word I would not fail to meet him at the time and
place appointed, God willing; so put on a clean shirt, and equippâ€™d
myself for the adventure. But considering I had a man of fortitude to
deal with, and one that would face any thing upon earth, except a cat,
which he hated much more than he did the sight of the devil; I
therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_196">{196}</a></span> thought policy beyond strength against such an adversary, so
resolvâ€™d to set my wits to work to prevent bloodshed, and fortunately
having a cat in my chamber that had not kittenâ€™d above a week? I took
the whole progeny out of the nest, which consisted of half a dozen, puts
three into one coat-pocket, and three into tâ€™other, and away I marchâ€™d
behind <i>Southampton-wall</i> to meet my antagonist; where I waited but a
few minutes eâ€™er he approachâ€™d the place in a great fury; I argued the
matter reasonably with him, but found nothing would atone for the
affront but downright fighting, so steping a few paces back, he gave me
the word and draws. I instead of applying my hands to my sword, applyâ€™d
them to my safer ammunition the kittens, and fortifies each fist with a
young Mrs. <i>Evans</i>; I gripâ€™d â€™em hard to make â€™em mew, that the onset
might be the more terrible; no sooner did he set his eyes upon his
little squawling adversaries, but away he scowerâ€™d, as if a legion of
devils had been in pursuit of him. I after him, tossing now and then one
of my hand-granadoes at him, but took care to pick them up again, lest
my ammunition should be spent. Who should follow me into the fields at a
distance by the scent, but the old one, in quest of her young, who by
this time came up with us, and seeing her hopeful issue thus terribly
abusâ€™d, she flew about like a fury; at first he only traversâ€™d his
ground at a little distance, but when he saw the mother of the family
come cocking her tail, whetting her talons, and staring worse than a
dead pig, he ran outright to <i>Totnam-Court</i>, as if vengeance had pursued
him, took sanctuary at <i>Inman</i>â€™s, since which retreat I have not yet
seen him; but for self-preservation, which you know is natureâ€™s law, I
have ever since walkâ€™d armâ€™d with a brace of kittens in my pocket, for
fear of farther danger.</p>

<p>These are late testimonials of my courage, to let you see I dare yet
meet any body upon the old killing spot, thoâ€™ he be a better man than
myself, and what is wanting in courage, I can supply with policy at any
time: therefore consider how much you wrong me when you accuse me of
idleness, since my prowess is sufficiently shewn in every days
adventure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>So much for my courage, and now for a few certificates of my wit, for
which the world, as well as yourself, knows I am equally famous: I
happenâ€™d the other day to be at <i>Nando</i>â€™s coffee-house in company with a
person, who was exclaiming heavily against a weaver of whores hair for
cheating him in a wig. Sir, said I, next time you have occasion for a
new noddle-case, if you please, Iâ€™ll recommend you to the honestest
perriwig maker in <i>Christendom</i>; I bought this wig on my head of him, it
cost me but fifteen shillings, and I have wore it <i>de die in diem</i> these
nine years and upwards, and you see itâ€™s not yet dwindled into
scandalous circumstances; and, Sir, if you please Iâ€™ll tell you for what
reason he can afford better penny-worths than the rest of the trade; in
the first place, you must know he dwells at <i>Chelmsford</i> in <i>Essex</i>, and
the country you are sensible admits of cheap living; in the next place,
he has nineteen daughters in his family, all bred up to his own trade,
who being kept unmarried, that their radical moisture should by no means
be exhausted, their own hair grows so prodigiously fast that it keeps
them all employâ€™d from the first day of <i>January</i>, to the last of
<i>December</i>, setting aside holy-days; once in four years he mows the
family round, never failing of a very plentiful crop; much about this
time I reckon his harvest is ripe, and all the neighbouring gentlemen
are flocking in to bespeak their perriwigs; some are fair girls, some
brown, some black, so that he can mix up a colour to suit any
complexion. And is this true, Sir, says the young priest? true, Sir,
said I, I hope you donâ€™t think me so little of a christian to impose
upon a scholar, a gentleman of your function: â€™tis so true, Sir, that it
brings a great trade to the town, and every body knows that <i>Essex</i>, for
<i>Chelmsford</i> wigs, and <i>Rumford</i> calves, out-does all the counties in
<i>England</i>. Say you so, says the <i>Levite</i>, I am come up to town about a
little business that will require my attendance about a fortnight, and
having a horse that has nothing else to do, Iâ€™ll eâ€™en make a journey
thither to morrow, and try if I can chaffer. Sir, said I, there is not
such hair in the kingdom of <i>England</i>, as in his family, for they are
all virtuous girls, and that makes their hair the stronger; besides, all
the clergy round him are his customers, because he makes up his wigs
without any mixture of whores hair; for as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">{198}</a></span> contagious fumes we are
sensible will corrupt the body, who knows but the effluvias emitted from
the locks of a polluted woman, hanging so near the noftrils may be
suckâ€™d in, to the strengthning of loose inclinations, and may beget an
appetite to fornication, too rebellious and powerful for reason to curb
into an orderly subjection. Well, says the young doctor, Iâ€™ll have one
of the wigs to carry into the country with me and please the pigs; at
<i>Chelmsford</i> you say? yes, Sir, at <i>Chelmsford</i> said I, the least child
in in the town knows him; ask but for the Barber and his nineteen
daughters, and you cannot miss of him.</p>

<p>Having thus laid the scene, I took my leave, and adjournâ€™d about the
business of the day, and coming from <i>Montague</i>â€™s shop three or four
days afterwards, I steppâ€™d into the same coffee-house, where I happenâ€™d
to meet with the spiritual pastor just coming to town, who had been
erring and straying like a lost sheep in quest of <i>Tonsor in nubibus</i>.
As soon as ever he set eyes upon me, he attackâ€™d me tooth and nail, with
as much fury as if I had been brother to the <i>Whore of Baylon</i>, and told
me I was some <i>Papist</i>, or otherwise a <i>Fanatick</i>, or else I would have
had more religion in me, than to have made a fool of a man of his
function, for that he had taken a journey on purpose to <i>Chelmsford</i>,
and could find no such barber. Pray, Sir, said I, donâ€™t be so angry, for
since I never gave ear to your preaching, why should you listen to my
prating? and since you make fools of a whole parish every sunday, how
can you be so angry with a man to make a fool of you once in his life
time? so turnâ€™d my back, and left the whole company to laugh at him.</p>

<p>You must know I love dearly to put a jest upon a priest, because it was
always my opinion, they put more jests upon the world than any people;
besides, any body may put a trick upon a block-head, but that conduces
but little to a manâ€™s reputation. I love to put my jokes upon men of
parts, that the world may see I can bite the biter; nothing carries the
burthen of another manâ€™s wit with a greater grace, than a sacerdotal
dromedary; therefore to let you see the wonderful regard I bear to
religion, I have one story, or piece of wit more to entertain you with,
that I hope may further divert you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_199">{199}</a></span></p>

<p>I chancâ€™d to be in company with a parcel of grave sermon-hunters, and
among a long catalogue of reverend orators, whose name should bring up
the rear of the eminent <i>Black-List</i>, but my honest neighbour the
deanâ€™s? I took not their flattery for my example, but gave my tongue the
liberty to speak as I thought, and said, he was a learned blockhead;
some of my good friends had the civility to report my saying to him.
Upon which, he sent the reader of the parish to admonish me, who came
one morning very solemnly to my chamber, and took upon him to tell me
how dishonourably and unchristian-like I had done, in aspersing the
doctor with the calumny of being a learned blockhead. Truly, Sir, said
I, I am sorry I should be so unmannerly to express my sentiments so
freely: but however, since it is done and canâ€™t be helpâ€™d, I desire you
will go back and tell him itâ€™s more than I can say by you, for thou art
a blockhead without any learning at all, and a fit man to be sent upon
such errands. Upon this answer he luggâ€™d his hat over his eyes, and ran
away as sullen and as silent as the devil pinchâ€™d by the nose did from
St. <i>Dunstan</i>, when the old gentleman had loosenâ€™d his barnacles.</p>

<p>Now for a piece of my poetry to let you see my talent is universal, and
then I believe I shall have quitted scores with you. In a hot sunshine
day this summer, when the sun was climbâ€™d to his meridian heighth, and
the progeny of every cow-turd had taken wing, and were buzzing about
streets in search of cooks shops, sugarbakers, and grocers, that a man
couâ€™d not walk <i>London</i>-streets without having his nose persecuted by
gnats, wasps or blue-bottles, my stomach, which is generally as forward
without sustenance at that hour, as a hungry sucking child without the
bubby, would not let me be at rest till I had purchased its pacification
at the expence of nine-pence; in order to gratify the cormorant, I
steppâ€™d into a cookâ€™s shop where a six-penny slice of veal was brought
me, so garnishâ€™d with fly-blows, that there lay a whole covey of the
little embroys upon every morsel, that I had more picking work than a
surgeon has with a patient whose buttocks are pepperâ€™d with small shot,
which put me in such a poetick fury, by that time I had half swallowed
up my noonings, that I pluckâ€™d out my pen and ink, and whilst my fancy
was warm writ a satire against <i>Fly-Blows</i>, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_200">{200}</a></span> perhaps you may
find as much wit and ill nature mixâ€™d artfully together as you may in
that incomparable satire, <i>The True-born Englishman</i>; so pray read and
judge favourably.</p>

<p><i>Sister Peg</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>F all the concubines in christendom, that ever were happy in so kind a
keeper, none sure ever squandered away the fruits of her labour so
indiscreetly as yourself; whoring and gaming I acknowledge are two very
serviceable vices in a common-wealth, because they make money circulate;
but for a woman that has enrichâ€™d herself by the one, to impoverish
herself by the other, is so great a fault, that a harlot deserves
correction for. Some people may think copulation a very easy and
delightful way of getting money, but they are much mistaken, for the
pains, you know as well as myself, which we take to please our
benefactors, destroy our own pleasure, and make it become a toil we are
forcâ€™d to sweat at. Then who, but you, that had acquired such plentiful
possessions by the labour of her bum, and sweat of her brows, would have
tossed away thousands in a night upon the chance of a card, or fate of a
die, as if you believed your honour was an <i>Indian</i> mine, which would
furnish you with gold to eternity for the trouble of digging: but now,
Madam, you find yourself mistaken, for those crows-feet that have laid
hold of the corners of your eyes, and wrinkly age, that in spight of
art, supplies the places of your absent charms, fright away the amorous
and the generous from your experiencâ€™d embraces: besides, women, I hear,
are so plentiful upon earth, that a lady of our quality, must be the
true copy of an angel in appearance, whose favours shall be thought
worth meat, drink, washing, lodging, and cloaths; so that a pretty woman
now a-days may make a slave of her bumfiddle for thirty years together,
and not get money enough to keep her out of an hospital, or an
alms-house at the age of fifty. I, you see, throâ€™ the whole course of my
life, maintainâ€™d my post, and as I was mistress to a king, livâ€™d as
great as a duchess to my last minute; and you, like an extravagant
concubine, to game away an estate, in few years, large enough to have
maintainâ€™d a score of younger brothers listed into your ladyshipâ€™s
service, who would have drudgâ€™d to oblige you as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_202">{202}</a></span> much as you did to
delight the good old gentleman that gave it to you; fie uponâ€™t, I am
ashamâ€™d to think, that a woman who had wit enough to tickle a prince out
of so fine an estate, should at last prove such a fool as to be bubbled
of it by a little spotted ivory and painted paper; if that mouth could
have spoke that had labourâ€™d hard to earn the penny, and miser-like was
always gaping for more riches, sure it would have scolded at your
profuse hands, for flinging away that estate so fast which they had but
a small share in getting of, but indeed it is not fit the silent beard
should know how much it has been abusâ€™d by the other parts of the body,
for if it did, it would be enough to put it into a pouting condition,
and make it open its sluice to the drowning of the low-countries in an
inundation of salt-water. I would advise you, Madam, with the small
remains of your squanderâ€™d fortune, to go into a nunnery, turn <i>Roman
Catholick</i>, which is the best religion in the universe, (for ladies of
your occupation, grow wonderful pious, and make a virtue of necessity)
and there remain till death, as a living testimony of the truth of the
old proverb, (<i>viz</i>) <i>That what is got over the devilâ€™s back, is spent
under his belly</i>: which is all the consolation you deserve from your
sister in iniquity,</p>

<p><i>Madam</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> AM sorry a mistress of a king should degenerate so much from that
generosity which was always applauded as a virtue in us ladies, who,
like the industrious beaver, do our business with our tails; for a woman
of my quality to value money, looks mean and mercenary, and is becoming
no body but an unmerciful miser, or a common strumpet; should I have
placâ€™d an esteem upon the riches that was left me, the world might have
supposâ€™d it was for the greediness of gain, that made me yield my
favours; and what had I been better than Madam <i>James</i>, or Mrs. <i>Knight</i>
of <i>Drury-lane</i>; had I exposâ€™d my honour for the lucre of base coin, and
sinned on for the sake only<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_203">{203}</a></span> of advantage. Beautyâ€™s the reward of great
actions, and I generously bestowâ€™d mine upon a prince that deservâ€™d it,
abstractly from the thoughts of interest, but rather to shew my
gratitude, in return of his noble passion for me; and since he had made
me the object of his affections, I resolved throâ€™ the true principle of
love to surrender the ultimate of my charms to make him happy: my
embraces was all he wanted, and the utmost I could give, and if a prince
would submit to take up with a player, I think on my side there was
honour enough, without interest, to induce me to a compliance. I know I
am old and past recovering an impairâ€™d fortune, after the same manner
that I first got it; but then consider what a small matter is sufficient
to keep a superanuated grannum, past the pleasures of this life; warm
cloathing and a few sugar-sops, what else can an old woman want, that is
fit for nothing but to mumble over her prayers, or sit nodding in a
chimney-corner like an old cat, when her company becomes as nauseous to
all that are younger than herself, as a sober divine is to a prophane
libertine? What conversation need she have besides one maid to exercise
her lungs upon, and keep lifeâ€™s bellows open? I am so far from repenting
the loss of my estate, that I look uponâ€™t my glory, and the only piece
of carelesness I ever committed worth my boasting. Itâ€™s a pleasure to me
to behold the vicissitude of fortune, and see her snatch that out of my
hand, which before she had dropped into my mouth; besides, without a
taste of poverty there can be no true repentance, for I always observe,
affliction goes a great way in making a good christian. I have said my
prayers within these few months, as heartily as ever I neglected â€™em,
and am often-times pleasâ€™d I am grown poor, because it makes me the more
pious: every fifty guineas I now lose, makes me when I come home, read a
chapter in <i>Job</i>, and take his patience for my own example. The gold
that I thus fling away, puts me in mind how sinfully it was got, and to
that cause I ascribe the badness of my fortune. To be rich and godly, I
have found very difficult, but to be needy and religious, is the easiest
thing in the world, which inclines me to believe poverty and piety, are
as great companions as impudence and ignorance, or love and jealousy; so
that when I have lost all, perhaps I may<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_204">{204}</a></span> take care to save myself,
which will be much better, than like you to be damnâ€™d with a full
pocket. It often makes me laugh to see hungry quality, craving
courtiers, as insatiate as the barren womb, how industrious they are to
add to their own estates by the ruin of an old fornicatrix, who can part
with her money as freely at one sport as she got it at another, and
therefore desires you will rest but as quietly under your damnation, as
she does under her losses, and she believes you will find yourself much
easier: So,</p>

<p><i>Most Reverend Brother in iniquity</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>F you donâ€™t remember of your own knowledge, you canâ€™t but have heard
from some of our grisly historians, that in the late times of confusion,
when the pious scoundrels of <i>England</i> arose with their arses uppermost,
I was not a man inferior in my function to your learned and most
eloquent self, or any other fanatick cackler of the holy law, by the
corruption of which (throâ€™ the spirit of nonsense, and grace of
blasphemy) our party has always supported the worst of causes in the
best of times; and be it known to you, brother doctor, for so I presume
to greet you, that I had not only the practical knack of moistning the
eyes of my congregation with the dreadful doctrine of predestination,
but could also dry up their tears with a spunge of comfort, and make â€™em
laugh as heartily whenever I pleasâ€™d, as a city-audience at a
<i>Smithfield</i>-comedy; in which most excellent and renownâ€™d faculties, you
are the only modern chatterist, that I hear has since succeeded me, for
which reason, I am very desirous of corresponding with you after this
manner, till fate shall give us your good company in these territories,
to which (if our subterranean governor changes not his opinion) you need
not doubt of being heartily welcome.</p>

<p>I am sensible news from another world to a man of curiosity, cannot but
be acceptable: I shall therefore proceed to give you some account how
our party (who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_205">{205}</a></span> very numerous) fare in these sultry dominions,
towards which I hope in a little time, you will set forward on your
journey.</p>

<p>My quondam master <i>Oliver Cromwell</i>, of ever famous memory, to whom upon
earth, you must know, I was not only chaplain in ordinary, but as well
jester to his excellency, an honour which I hear most noblemen confer
upon the black robe, now good old house-keeping, and the party-colourâ€™d
coat are quite thrown out of fashion: My master, I say, who in honour to
his <i>exit</i>, was fetchâ€™d away out of the upper world in a whirlwind, and
conducted into these parts with all the solemnities of an usurper, was
establishâ€™d in a notable post at his first admittance into <i>Pluto</i>â€™s
court, in which eminent employment (that like a faithful servant
followâ€™d him) I found him, to my great satisfaction. <i>Alecto</i>, one of
the furies, having taken a surfeit with over-flogging <i>Guido Vaux</i>
(which is a ceremony performâ€™d here in publick every fifth of
<i>November</i>) for discovering the <i>Gun-Powder-Treason-Plot</i>, and defeating
that notable design, which by the indefatigable industry of the most
skilful politicians on this side <i>Acheron</i>, was so hopefully projected:
and fearing some disorders should arise in our infernal common-wealth
for want of strict discipline, my old master <i>Oliver</i> was pitchâ€™d on to
be deputy-firker to the sick beldam, and a scorpion-rod was accordingly
presented him, with all the usual ceremonies of so grand an instalment.
This news of his advancement was so terrible a conflict to the cavalier
part, who dreading the severity of his correction, petitionâ€™d <i>Pluto</i> to
remove him, but to no purpose; which insolence so inflamâ€™d my cholerick
master, that his nose swellâ€™d as big at the end as an apple-dumpling,
and lookâ€™d as fiery red (to the terror of those that came under his
lash) as if his magnificent gigg had been a living salamander, so that
wherever he met with a cavalier, he did so firk and jirk him, that
<i>Busby</i> was never a greater terror to a blockhead, or the <i>Bridewell</i>
flog-master to a night-walking strumpet, than he at this day to a
high-flyer or a Jacobite. Great regard has been shewn by his infernal
majesty, to all that in <i>forty eight</i> were members of the high court of
justice; some are made master and wardens of the devilâ€™s mint, for the
coining of new sins; some commissioners of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_206">{206}</a></span> temptation-office;
others, barons of the diabolical stinkports; and particularly
sollicitor-general <i>Cook</i> is made lord-keeper of hellâ€™s punishments; and
<i>Bradshaw</i> and <i>Ireton</i>, two of his imperial smuttinessâ€™s
privy-counsellors: So that all the posts of honour and preferment in
these lower regions are in the hands of our party, hoping those of the
same kidney who live over our heads, enjoy the like advantages, as we
have heard below by a certain courier from <i>Amsterdam</i>, you are all
pretty firmly possessâ€™d of.</p>

<p>There lately arrivâ€™d in these parts a certain woolen-draper out of
<i>Covent-Garden</i> parish, who being touchâ€™d with a deep sense of
ingratitude, could not rest quietly in his whigwam, till he had made a
publick confession of a great indignity he had put upon Mrs. <i>Meg</i>â€™s
chaplain, by which he gave us to understand you were the worthy
gentleman he had most sordidly affronted; the manner of which he
declared with as much sorrow and concern for the action, as ever was
beheld in the face of a dying penitent, between the severity of a
halter, and decency of a night-cap, the substance of his report being to
this purpose; after he had fetchâ€™d two or three deep sighs, as loud as
the puffs of a smithâ€™s bellows: alas! says he, to you I speak, good
people, that are here about me, I was blessâ€™d with a wife of such
singular piety in the other world, who rather than not hear that
reverend teacher of the gospel <i>D. B.</i> twice every <i>Sunday</i>, she would
cackle for a whole week, far worse than an old hen that has dropâ€™d a
benefit to her owner; whilst I, like a true profligate suburbian, usâ€™d
to confound her zeal, stop the current of her devotion, and damn her
hypocrisy; but the good woman was too strict a protestant to be thus
seducâ€™d, and still perseverâ€™d in spight of all restriction in her
accustomary righteousness, till at last I bethought myself the best way
to reclaim her from this disagreeable purity (for so I thought it) and
bring her over, like me her husband, to be a good sociable sinner, was
to keep a close guard over my pocket, and another over my till, well
considering, that if the flock could not live without spiritual
consolation, the shepherd could not spend his lungs without temporal
subsistence: After I had tryâ€™d this experiment for about a fortnight
before the time of contribution, when the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_207">{207}</a></span> of the hearers are
usually as open as their teacherâ€™s conscience, I found my wifeâ€™s
extraordinary zeal had stirrâ€™d up a tumultuous spirit within her, so
that nothing would pacify her stubborn disposition, but ten times the
price of a fat pig, to gratify the great benefits she had often receivâ€™d
from her soul-saving physician; but I, looking into the merits of the
cause, and finding other mens wives usâ€™d to be savâ€™d, (or at least made
believe so) at a much cheaper rate, and therefore for good reasons best
known to myself, would by no means comply with her religious generosity;
upon which the good woman my wife, lest she should be thought an
ungrateful reprobate by her deserving guide, conveyâ€™d a present to the
worthy doctor of a whole piece of black cloth, without my knowledge, and
like a true lover of peace and quietness, conjured my apprentice to keep
it secret; but my manâ€™s honesty being equal to my wifeâ€™s religion, in a
little time after, he informâ€™d me of the matter, upon which (forgive me
good people) I waited upon the doctor with a bill, and without any
tenderness to his piety, or regard to his function, gave him such a
tallymanâ€™s dun, that he swore throâ€™ divinity, and denyâ€™d the matter of
fact as sturdily as if he had been bred a citizen; yet at last, upon
positive proof thereof, paid the money like an honest gentleman, but
huffâ€™d away as if the passion of envy had overcome the patience of the
priest. But since I find (most worthy gentlemen) that fate has doomâ€™d me
to these sulphurous mansions, where the devil rules the roast, and
presbytery flourishes; I here, before the protector of this
commonwealth, and all his infernal host, submit myself to the present
government in hell establishâ€™d, and heartily declare a penitential
sorrow for the indignity offerâ€™d upon earth to that famous and most
spiritual kid-napper, who I cannot but acknowledge has contributed more
toward the peopling of these dominions, than the states of <i>Holland</i>
have ever done towards the peopling your neighbouring country the
<i>East-Indies</i>.</p>

<p>But now, brother doctor, to make you sensible of the interest you have
in these parts, the audience (notwithstanding the offenderâ€™s submission)
were so highly inflamâ€™d that so disgraceful an affront should be put
upon so worthy a benefactor to the <i>good old cause</i>, that some cryâ€™d
out<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_208">{208}</a></span> with a true spirit of dissention, <i>Flay, flay the rogue, flay him
for a</i> cavalier, <i>what abuse the Doctor! Others, Scald him, scald him,
heâ€™s a Church Papist: Others, Geld him, geld him, heâ€™s certainly a
Priest</i>: But the women were against the last sentence, and cryâ€™d the
devil had no law for that severity. So a great hurliburly arose about
the manner of his punishment; but at last the crowd hurryâ€™d him away as
the rabble in your world do a pickpocket, to a pump, or a horse-pond,
and what became of him afterwards I have not yet heard.</p>

<p>We have abundance of souls flock hither daily, that bring us in very
comfortable tidings from <i>Mincing-lane</i>, <i>Salters-hall</i>,
<i>Bishopsgate-street</i>, <i>Jewen-street</i>, <i>Moorfields</i>, <i>Bartholomew-close</i>,
<i>Fetter-lane</i>, <i>Stepney</i>, <i>Hackney</i>, <i>Bednal-green</i>, &amp;c. but more
particularly from <i>Covent-Garden</i>; among whom, to your credit it be it
spoken, I have always pickâ€™d out the most agreeable conversation: for
you must know, a little before I absented myself from the pleasures of
the upper world, â€™twas my fortune to be haulâ€™d before a dozen of damnâ€™d
crabbed <i>cavaliers</i>, revengeful fellows, who lookâ€™d as if they would
lose a dinner to hang an honest round-head at any time; and as three or
four tun-bellyâ€™d lumps of gravity, in blushing formalities, linâ€™d with
coney-skins, and those twelve unlucky disciples orderâ€™d the matter (to
show they were all fire and tow) they told me a dreadful story of
hanging and burning at <i>Charing-Cross</i>, in sight of that old palace we
before had plunderâ€™d. About which ugly sort of business, when I came to
find they were in good earnest, I began to grow as, dizzy in my brains,
as a hog troubled with the megrims, and could no more endure the
thoughts onâ€™t than I could of <i>Popery</i>; on my dying day, I strove all I
could to make it easy, but I protest it was in vain, for it provâ€™d still
as hateful to me, as castration to a priest, or barrenness to a young
woman: in short, at last it made me think of nothing but rattling of
chains, and picking of straws, insomuch that when they fagotted up my
thumbs together, and tumbled me into a hell-cart well litterâ€™d with
straw, but the devil a wheel toâ€™t, I did but just shut my eyes, and
fancyâ€™d myself to be in a dark room in <i>Bedlam</i>. In this manner they
rumbled me throâ€™ a long lane of spectators, who starâ€™d at me as if I had
been a <i>rhinoceros</i> with a <i>Bantam</i> queen upon my back;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_209">{209}</a></span> at last they
draggâ€™d me into an ill-favourâ€™d piece of timber, in the shape of a welch
sign-post, where they tuckâ€™d me up to a beam, and made me keck a little,
as if something had gone the wrong way; upon which I fell into a kind of
a hag-ridden slubber for a quarter of an hour, dreaming I sunk a
thousand leagues into the bowels of the earth, and no sooner awakâ€™d, but
found myself, as I told you before, in company with my old master: my
sleep provâ€™d much too short for the recovery of my senses, and thoâ€™ I
saw several of my old friends about me, the pain of my neck, and terror
of my fall, made me rave worse than a narrow-scutted punk under the
hands of a mad-midwife; till by the advice of a consult of physicians,
who are here as numerous as <i>crocodiles</i> in the land of <i>Egypt</i>; a
vesicatory of devilâ€™s-dung was applyâ€™d to my <i>costern</i>, which restorâ€™d
me to my wits in a few minutes, which in the time of adversity, like
ungovernable rebels, had abdicated their master. But that which most
troubled me when I found myself <i>compos mentis</i>, was the circular
impression the hempen collar had left about my gullet, by which the
fellow-subjects discoverâ€™d I swung into hell the back way, for which
reason some prodigal <i>jack-a-dandies</i> refusâ€™d to keep me company,
despising me as much as a butcher does a bull-dog, that instead of
running fair at the head, catches hold of the tail, and hangs at the
arse of his enemy; for you must know, doctor, the most reputable way of
entring into this sub-terrestial country, is to come in at the
fore-door, throâ€™ which none are admitted but such as spend their full
time in wickedness in the upper world without flinching: nay be as proud
of a notorious sin, as a jockey is of his riding that has won a
horse-race, and glory more in the invention of a new vice, than a coward
does of a victory, till at last, by the effects of his debaucheries,
pox, gout and rheumatism, he is lifted out of your world into ours,
without one thought of repentance. These are highly rewarded here for
the glorious examples they have left behind them; but he that comes
hither like a dog, with the print of a collar about his neck, is no more
respected than a prophet in his own country; the reason is, because they
who pass gallows-way into these shades, generally at their <i>exit</i>, show
a sorrow for their sins; so that if heaven did not take their contrition
for a kind of death-bed repentance the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_210">{210}</a></span> devil would be a great loser;
besides, they soften the hearts of sinners by their sniveling and
howling, and deter others from the like wickedness. These considerations
occasion the tyburnians to be very much slighted by other company: but
I, throâ€™ good fortune, by that time I had been here a fortnight, met
with a good honest shoemaker, who had cut his throat in a garret in
<i>Russel-street</i>, upon the point of <i>Predestination</i>, which he had heard
you handling of for three hours together the very same afternoon, before
he could find in his heart to perform the decent execution. Upon serious
examination, I found the fellow talkâ€™d very notably of religion; nay,
much better than he did of a shoe-soal, or an upper-leather; he had such
an assurance of his parts, as to challenge <i>Bunyan</i> the tinker to chop
logick with him; and <i>Naylor</i> the quaker, who was of a principle between
both, was thought the best qualifyâ€™d person in all hell for an impartial
moderator; but your nimble choppâ€™d pupil was as much too cunning for the
<i>Pilgrim</i> author, as a fox is for a badger, that at last the shoemaker
got his ends, and left the poor tinker without one argument in his
budget. By the assistance of this honest cordwainer, (who hearing I had
been a minister of the gospel in the other world, was mighty respectful
to me) I got acquainted with several others, who had been of your
congregation; some old women, who had hangâ€™d themselves in their
garters, throâ€™ fear the lord had not elected them: others, who had
waited for a call to heaven till their last dram of patience, as well as
their patrimony, were quite exhausted, the first in religious exercises,
and the last in holy offerings to you their teacher; and finding very
little come of either, they resolvâ€™d the king shouâ€™d lose a poor
subject, and yourself a pious communicant; and so by the judicious
application of either knife or halter, conveyâ€™d themselves throâ€™ death
to these infernal shades, which they always livâ€™d in dread of, but not
finding the climate so terribly hot on this side <i>Styx</i>, as you have
often represented it, they rest well satisfyâ€™d in their conditions, and
all heartily present their humble service to you, hoping with myself,
you will always stick close to your old doctrine, and labour hard to
support and infuse into your followers, the true enthusiastick
principles of <i>Fanaticism</i>, and you need not question but to wallow in
the pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_211">{211}</a></span> of human life whilst above board, and be doubly damnâ€™d
hereafter among us for the signal services you have done to the sable
protector of these populous territories, which can never want recruits,
whilst there is a <i>Burgess</i> in the upper world, and a <i>Lucifer</i> in the
lower one.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Receivâ€™d your insolent epistle with no small dissatisfaction, and had
you not informâ€™d me, I should have guessâ€™d it came from hell, and that
none but the devil, besides yourself, could have digitisâ€™d a pen after
so scurrillous a manner: how I came to be your brother, as you are
pleasâ€™d very sawcily to call me, I canâ€™t tell, for thou werâ€™t no more
than a meer pulpit merry-andrew, fit only to jest poor ignorant wenches
out of their bodkins and thimbles, and I, <i>Daniel Burgess</i> am known
throâ€™ all <i>England</i> to be a reverend teacher of the good word the
gospel, and a saver of souls by the means of grace, and the help of
mercy.</p>

<p>â€™Tis true, I cannot but acknowledge that you were a serviceable agent in
the promotion of the <i>good old cause</i>; but when you came to die a martyr
for it, the whimsical fear of damnation so disturbâ€™d your fly-blown
brains, that a dog hangâ€™d by a cleanly housewife for dropping a
sirreverence in a room new washâ€™d, or a cat condemnâ€™d to the same
punishment for licking up the childrens milk, were never certainly such
a scandal to a halter, as thy frantick self. When like a true teacher of
spiritual dissention, thou shouldâ€™st have gloryâ€™d in all the past
actions of thy life, that had the least tendency to the pulling down of
that papistical government, that whore of <i>Babylon</i>, monarchy, and
setting up in its stead, that wholesome and inseparable twins,
presbytery and a commonwealth; you hastenâ€™d on your own damnation by
foolish fear and cowardly repentance, and shewâ€™d fifty times more
distraction than a horn-mad cuckold, that had catchâ€™d his wife playing
at flipflap with her tail like a live flownder in a frying-pan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<p>As for that woolen jack-a-dandy, that fed his family by the product of a
sheeps-back, that unrighteous tell-tail rogue, that usâ€™d to curse his
wife for being godly, if ever you will do me a piece of good service in
your damnable country, I beg you to entreat <i>Lucifer</i> on my behalf, to
freeze him once a day into a cake of ice, and then thaw him without
mercy, in one of his hottest hell-kettles; or let him be floggâ€™d three
times a day by your old master, worse than <i>Titus Oates</i>, or brother
<i>Johnson</i>, for heâ€™s as rank a cavalier as ever had the impudence to spit
in a round-headâ€™s face, or speak treason against the rump-parliament;
and tell him, thoâ€™ he made me pay for the cloth, given me as a just
reward of my pastoral care of his wifeâ€™s immortality, yet she had the
christian gratitude, to make me doubly amends before a fortnight was
expirâ€™d; but how the donor came by the benefit she bestowâ€™d, I thought
was a little ungrateful for the receiver to enquire into, and unbecoming
a minister of the word, bearing my figure and character.</p>

<p>As for the sorry wretches you mention, who by the virtue and efficacy of
my doctrine, took a by-path into the other world, that happenâ€™d to lead
â€™em into your territories: I must tell you, they were such a parcel of
scoundrels, whose diminutive souls I lookâ€™d upon to be meer trumpery,
damagâ€™d goods, not worthy their freight, fit for nothing but to be
thrown over-board; poor tatterâ€™d scraps of immortality crouded into
skins, each of less value than a hogâ€™s-pudding. <i>Lucifer</i> himself, Iâ€™m
sure, should he wage new war with heaven, would not have given
three-pence a-piece to have lifted them into his service, they would not
have been fit for so much as powder-monkeys, to have handed fire and
brimstone after the army; for my part, I wonder now you have got â€™em,
how you bestow â€™em, or what use the devil can put â€™em to; I protest when
they were living upon earth, I found them such needy communicants, I
thought them fitter to be confinâ€™d within the narrow limits of some old
alms-house for subsistance, there to read and practise Mr. <i>Tryon</i>â€™s
water-gruel directory, and enjoy the charitable income of
three-half-pence a day, settled by some old rogue who had cheated the
world of thousands, and hopes to make an atonement by starving perhaps
twenty old wo<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_213">{213}</a></span>men every year in his little row of charity pigeon-holes,
endowâ€™d with nine-pence <i>per</i> week, and a thimbleful of coals; as if
providing a miserable life for one person, was a sufficient recompence
for cheating another: I say, they were fitter to be made close tenants
to some such bountiful nest of drawers, than to come like a parcel of
thread-bare zealots into a meeting, like bullies into a tavern, without
a penny of money in their pockets, and disturb people of good fashion
and credit, zealous benefactors to their guide, in the height of their
devotion, an intolerable grievance to a pious congregation, that pay
well for the assurance of salvation: and if we did not sometimes by the
frightful doctrine of <i>non-election</i> and <i>damnation</i>, make these
ragamuffin reprobates take up the knife of dispair, and clear the garden
of the righteous from those rascally poor weeds who are always sucking
juice from the more valuable plants, in a little time the fruitful soil
would be so over-run with docks and nettles, that there would be no
living for the gardner, whose profits must arise from the products of
those trees laden with rich fruit, which for yielding plentifully in due
season, become more worthy of his care.</p>

<p>This is the case, and therefore who can blame me for my doctrine, if it
should be a means of making two or three garetteers, and as many
cellar-divers, by the help of twisted-hemp, or cold iron, forward their
journies to the lord knows whither, the world has the less to provide
for, and those that are gone have, according to the opinion of our
fore-fathers, nothing to care for? So to tell you the truth onâ€™t, I am
never without a score of such communicants to spare, and if they were
all to be with you before night, I should think it a very comfortable
riddance.</p>

<p>I am sorry I have not so much time to abuse you as I could heartily wish
I had, for you cannot but be sensible how much you have deservâ€™d it, and
how well qualified I am for such an undertaking, if I had but leisure to
exert my talent; and why we of the same function should treat one
another scurvily, would be no wonder, because two of a trade can never
agree; however I shall reserve my fury till another opportunity, being
just now invited to a supper by a devout communicant, whose husbandâ€™s in
the country, and I am sure she will have provided something<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_214">{214}</a></span> worth my
nibbling at, which I scorn to lose the benefit of for a piece of
revenge: so farewel,</p>

<p><i>Most diabolical Sons of Darkness</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">O</span>F all the villainies perpetrated upon earth, that the greatest rebel
could be proud of, or <i>Lucifer</i> blush at, I myself hid so large a share
in, that the devil for my hearty sincerity, and trusty management
therein, gives me the right-hand, dignifyâ€™d and distinguishâ€™d me with
the superb title of his elder brother: no man ever gloried more in
wickedness than myself, and that which now makes my punishment a
pleasure, is to think how nobly I deserved it. Many I know are the
treasonable plots and contrivances transacted in the upper world, but
never was any magnificent piece of wickedness, or superlative deed of
devilism, ever performed with more ostentation and alacrity, than that
most impious and audacious act, in which I was so highly concerned, and
that the very monarch of hell might have been proud to have had a hand
in; to fire churches, commit sacrilege, ravish virgins, murder infants,
or spit in the faces of our parents, are trifling sins that a man of my
figure in iniquity would be ashamâ€™d to be caught in; but to murder the
best of princes, and glory in the deed, is such an infernal evil that
hell canâ€™t blacken, or earth canâ€™t parallel; a sacred piece of villany
becoming only the treachery of a puritan to execute, and the pen and
principles of a <i>Tutchin</i> to endeavour to justify.</p>

<p><i>Lucifer</i> and all his kingdom of hob-gobblins, drink a health to your
society every thirtieth of <i>January</i>, in burnt brandy, and are well
assurâ€™d the interest of these infernal territories can never sink, as
long as there is a <i>Calves-Head Club</i> upon earth, to glory in the
remembrance of the worst of villianies; and a whiggish society of
reformation, for the better establishment of hypocrisy. We, who had the
honour to be his majestyâ€™s judges, or rather as some<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_215">{215}</a></span> call us,
<i>Regicides</i>, are all messâ€™d together in an apartment by ourselves, and
the murderers of <i>Henry</i> III. and <i>Henry</i> IV. of <i>France</i> are appointed
to attend us at our table; and Felton that stabbâ€™d the duke of
<i>Buckingham</i>, is our lacquey to run of errands.</p>

<p>In all <i>Lucifer</i>â€™s extensive dominions, there is not one society so much
respected as ourselves, and the greatest villains that ever were upon
earth, are by the devil, when they come here, scarce thought wicked
enough to wait upon us in the most servile station; the very jesuits
themselves known by all the world to value royal blood no more than a

yards of us; nay, the very dissenting shepherds of that rebellious
flock, who always followâ€™d me as their only bell-weather, are not here
thought worthy of our conversation, only now and then a member of our
sanctifyâ€™d society the <i>Calves-Head Club</i>, drops headlong in among us,
and <i>Old Nic</i> indeed appoints them to grind mustard and scrape horse
radish for us his well-beloved brethren the <i>Regicides</i>; for you must

in very hot sauces, and that most delicate palate-scorching soop called
pepper-pot, a kind of devilâ€™s broth much eat in the <i>West-Indies</i>, is
always the first dish brought to our table.</p>

<p>All hell applauds you mightily for your zeal and integrity for the <i>good
old cause</i>, and your cordial approbation of the great effects thereof,
which you annually show upon every thirtieth of <i>January</i> that
derisionary festival, which you keep like the bold sons of confusion,
that the true spirit of rebellion may never die, and the dreadful
consequences of a damnable reformation may never be forgotten, in which
most notable, audacious and courageous piece of insolence, you not only
declare yourselves the brave defenders of all king-killing principles,
but plainly discover your undaunted souls are ready upon all occasions
of the like nature, to solemnly engage in the most startling mischief
that hellâ€™s most politick <i>Divan</i> are willing to contrive, or a body of
the most resolute infidels in the universe able to perpetrate? this do I
speak to your eternal reputation, that <i>Lucifer</i> and all his sable
legions have publickly acknowledged their pride and malice, are much<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_216">{216}</a></span>
out-done by your private assembly, and the expertest devils among all
the infernal host, turn pale with envy, and degenerate from their
blackness to see their impudence outbrazenâ€™d by a club of mortal
puritans? so that I would advise you as a friend, when death, by virtue
of his uncontroulable <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, shall remove you to these dusky
confines, you will put on a little modesty, thoâ€™ you play the hypocrite,
least if you behave yourselves here as you do in the upper world, you
shall dash the devil out of countenance.</p>

<p><i>Most Noble Colonel</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E receivâ€™d your letter, wherein your hatred to kings is discernable in
your stile; you scorn, like ourselves, the flattery of a courtier, and
write to your friends in the rough language of a bold soldier, that did
not only dare to uncrown, but to unhead a monarch, to advance the
authority of the good people of <i>England</i> above sovereign domination,
and free them from the bridle of the laws, which are no more in our
opinion than a politick restraint upon their natural freedom, an act
worthy of so indefatigable a patriot, who would leave no stone unturnâ€™d,
that the wrong side of every thing might be raisâ€™d uppermost, and that
those who had long against their wills been brought under a compulsive
subjection, might once have an opportunity of trampling upon that
ambition to which they were once slaves, and of raising up their
groveling snouts above that aspiring head, which for many ages had
oppressâ€™d millions of mankind by the dint of power eclipsâ€™d their native
liberty, and crushed them into a slavish obedience.</p>

<p>What ass in the universe would not kick at his master, if he was sure he
could knock his head off, and shake off that burthen beneath which he
groans, if he was not such a coward to be fearful of a greater?
Rebellion is always sanctifyed if it succeeds well, and the end
proposâ€™d, obtainâ€™d with safety, always gives glory to the atchieve<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_217">{217}</a></span>ment.
Authority is only obeyâ€™d, because â€™tis fearâ€™d; and if once trodden under
foot, nothing appears so despicable, as he that mounts a resty steed is
counted a good horseman, if he tames the beast; but if the stubborn
courser throws his rider, he falls a laughing stock to the glad
spectators.</p>

<p>You seem to be truly sensible how much we glory in that act, which ought
to be as much your pride, as it is our satisfaction: we reverence the
valiant arm that did the deed, and daily signalize our gratitude to the
pious memory of those illustrious heroes, who by their undaunted
magnanimity brought their unparallellâ€™d undertakings to a hopeful issue,
and left behind them such a glorious example, which we shall never
neglect to imitate when ourselves have opportunity. We have long hoped
for the lucky minute, wherein we might shew the world the strength of
our resolutions, and the constancy of our principles, and make those
cowardly slaves know, who pretend an abhorrence to your past bravery,
that we are the cocks, when we dare crow, that will make the lion
tremble; we have at all times when we meet, an ax hung up in our
club-room, in <i>pia memoria</i> of your sacred action: but had we the true
weapon, as much as we hate popery, we should turn idolaters, and worship
it much more than <i>Roman Catholicks</i> do their pictures. We have every
thirtieth of <i>January</i> a <i>calves-head feast</i>, in contempt of that head
which fell a glorious sacrifice to your justice, over which we drink to
the pious memory of <i>Oliver Cromwell</i>; confusion to monarchy; to the
downfal of episcopacy; a health to every noble regicide, and to the
universal propagation of all king-killing principles; and if these are
not meritorious formalities, and decent observances, we know not how to
oblige our honest brethren, who are co-habitants with you at such a
distance beneath us.</p>

<p>To be accounted rebels and bold villains, does not in any measure make
us uneasy; for the believing ourselves otherwise, is a compleat
satisfaction to ballance their envy that so think us; besides the
pleasure we find in accounting them fools, slaves and cowards, is really
more to us than a sufficient recompence: so that by our vilifying our
opposites, we deny them opportunity ever to be even with us. The author
of the dialogue between <i>Vassal</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_218">{218}</a></span> and <i>Freeman</i>, is our secretary; you
guessâ€™d his name very right in your letter, and a notable fellow he is
either in verse or prose, for the justification of our principles; and
is such a desperate tongue-stabbing hero at <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, that he
clears the house of all people wherever he comes, but those of his own
kidney; he vindicates all the proceedings of the <i>High Court of
Justice</i>, with such admirable obstinacy and impudence, that the best
lawyer in <i>Westminster-hall</i> is not able to cope with him, and justifies
the bringing of a king to a scaffold, when the people dislike his
stewardship, with so much insolence and arrogance, and drags him to a
block, as you would a bear to a stake, with so much decency, that had he
livâ€™d in the happy days when you erected a <i>High Court of Justice</i>, he
would have been the fittest man in the universe for two posts under you;
<i>First</i>, To have been attorney-general, and then executioner, and would,
I am confident, have so strenuously exerted himself in both offices,
that he would have gained a double reputation with our godly party.
<i>First</i>, For the discharge of the one with the utmost malignancy. And,
<i>Secondly</i>, For the dispatch of the other without disguise; for I dare
be confident, he has assurance enough to go through-stitch with any
thing that the world calls villainy, if we but think it virtue without
the fear of shame, or dread of punishment: indeed, had our growing
principles at this day but such another champion to defend â€™em, I do not
question but in a few years we might bring matters to bear, and by
downright dint of our own weapon, <i>calumny</i>, make way to play the old
game over again, to a far better purpose than has been yet effected.
With the great hopes of which we take leave at present, desiring your
brother <i>Lucifer</i> upon all occasions to lend us his assistance. So we
subscribe ourselves both his and your</p>

<p><i>Friends and Brethren in the Spirit</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU who are the true transcript of the people originally callâ€™d
<i>Quakers</i>, may perhaps expect, that I <i>James Naylor</i> in the dark, should
commend my hearty love to you my friends in the light, in such like
manner as the spirit usâ€™d to dictate to me upon earth, before I
unhappily fell under this wonderful transfiguration, which I now am
appointed to maintain throâ€™ the whole course of eternity.</p>

<p>I had no sooner set footing into this deep abyss of midnight, to which
the sun, moon and stars are as great strangers, as frost and snow are to
the country of <i>Ethiopia</i>, but a parcel of black spiritual janizaries
saluted me as intimately as if I had been resident in these parts during
the term of an apprenticeship; at last up comes a swindging lusty,
over-grown, austre devil, armâ€™d with an ugly weapon like a country dung
fork, looking as sharp about the eyes as a <i>Woodstreet</i> officer, and
seemâ€™d to deport himself after such a manner, that discovered he had an
ascendency over the rest of the immortal negroes, and, as I imaginâ€™d, so
â€™twas quickly evident; for as soon as he espied me leering between the
diminutive slabbering-bib, and the extensive brims of my cony-wool
umbrella, he chucks me under the chin with his ugly toad-colourâ€™d paw,
that stunk as bad of brimstone as a card-match new lighted, crying, How
now, honest <i>James</i>, I am glad to see thee on this side the river
<i>Styx</i>, prithee hold up thy beard, and donâ€™t be ashamâ€™d, thou art not
the first quaker by many thousands that has sworn allegiance to my
government; besides, thou hast been one of my best benefactors upon
earth, and now thou shalt see like a grateful devil, Iâ€™ll reward thee
accordingly: I thank your excellency kindly, said I, pray what is it
your infernal protectorship will be pleasâ€™d to confer upon me? To which
his mighty ugliness replyâ€™d, friend <i>Naylor</i>, I know thou hast been very
industrious to make many people fools in the upper world, which has
highly conducâ€™d to my interest. Then turning to a pigmy aÃ«rial, who
attended his commands as a run<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_220">{220}</a></span>ning footman; haste, <i>Numps</i>, says he,
and fetch me the painted coat, which was no sooner brought, but, by
<i>Lucifer</i>â€™s command, I was shovâ€™d into it neck and shoulders, by half a
dozen smutty <i>valets de chambre</i>, and in a minuteâ€™s time found my self
trickâ€™d up in a rainbow-colourâ€™d coat, like a merry-andrew. Now, friend,
says the ill-favourâ€™d prince of all the hell-born scoundrels, for the
many fools you have made above, I now ordain you mine below; so all the
reward, truly, of my great services, was to be made <i>Lucifer</i>â€™s jester,
or fool in ordinary to the devil: a pretty post, thought I, for a man of
my principles, that from a quaker in the other world, I should be
metamorphosed into a jack-adams in the lower one. I could not but think
it a strange kind of mutation, and knew no more how to behave myself in
my gaudy-colourâ€™d robes, than if I had been damnâ€™d, and crammâ€™d into a
tortoise-shell, and must have walkâ€™d about hell upon all fours with a
house upon my back.</p>

<p>In a little time after this new dignity was conferrâ€™d upon me, the devil
happenâ€™d to make a splendid entertainment for all the souls in his
dominion, who in the upper world had been professâ€™d Quakers, where I,
quoth the fool, was ordered to give my attendance for the diversion of
the company, but found myself so strangely disappointed when I beheld
the guests, that had I been messed in <i>Noah</i>â€™s ark among lyons, bears,
and alligators, I could not have been more amazâ€™d than I was at the
unexpected appearance and deportment of such a confusâ€™d assembly: my
master <i>Lucifer</i>, and <i>Ramsey</i> the jesuit at his right hand, sat at the
upper end of the table, and the rest of the scrambling company were
seated like so many hungry mechanicks at a corporation-feast; but
instead of their conversation being <i>Yea</i> and <i>Nay</i>, there never was
heard such swearing and cursing at a publick gaming-table, nor all the
points of copulation more lewdly discussâ€™d at a bawdy-house; blasphemy
was the modestest of their talk, and there I came in with â€™em for a
foolâ€™s share, and exerted my talent to the approbation and applause of
the whole society.</p>

<p>Observing such a wonderful change in these our infernal friends, from
what they appeared to be in the upper world, made my curiosity itch
mightily to know the rea<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_221">{221}</a></span>son of this surprising alteration; upon which,
said I, prithee <i>Lucifer</i>, in plain words, (for we fools you must know
may say any thing to our masters) what is the meaning that these people
who were <i>quondam</i> quakers when upon <i>terra firma</i>, should turn such
debauchâ€™d libertines in these lower regions, and from the most religious
and precise of all hypocritical heaven-servers, to become the most
degenerate reprobates in all your damnable dominions? Iâ€™ll tell you,
says <i>Lucifer</i>, the reason; always those that pretended to the greatest
purity in the other world, put on the cloak of religion, not to save
their souls but to hide their vices, as some women wear masks, not to
preserve their beauty, but to hide their ugliness; and when that veil is
taken away which obscurâ€™d the sinfulness of their natures, or when
opportunity gives them leave to be wicked without damage to their
interest (as they may here) you see how loose and wanton the most
zealous of both sexes will be, notwithstanding all the external promises
of piety and vertue. These words, thoâ€™ they came from the father of
lies, yet their satirical force gave me such a stab in the conscience,
that had my label of mortality been stung by a wasp or a hornet, it
could not have grievâ€™d the outward man more, than this diabolical saying
did the inward; and knowing by experience it savourâ€™d of a little truth,
I thought I could do no more than communicate his answer to you my
friends, who are lovers of verity, from whence you may discern with half
an eye, that <i>Satan</i> understands you as well as he does the college of
<i>Jesuits</i>, or a <i>Dutch</i> conventicle, and if you take not timely care,
will certainly prove too cunning for you.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will think me a very imperfect intelligencer, to tell you of
a feast, and give you no account of the provisions, or what sort food
the devil in his sultry dominions entertains his friends withal;
therefore in the next place I shall venture to give you a bill of fare,
that you may know at present what you may expect hereafter, lest
otherwise I should leave your curiosities unsatisfied, and keep you
ignorant of those avernous dainties by which immortality is here
subsisted.</p>

<p>The first course consisted of a huge platterful of scorpions
spits-cockâ€™d, a fricassee of young salamanders, a bailiffâ€™s rump
roasted, baisted with its own dung, and a cock phÅ“<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">{222}</a></span>nix scalded in his
feathers, smotherâ€™d with melted soap and boilâ€™d arsnick; these were
gross, substantial meats, designâ€™d chiefly for keen appetites. The
second course containâ€™d six dozen of <i>West-India</i> gwanas roasted in
their own shells, a dish of squab-hickaries poachâ€™d, a brace of flying
dragons stewâ€™d in their own blood, and a dish of shovel-nosâ€™d sharks
fryâ€™d with a leviathan in the middle, tossâ€™d up with whatâ€™s as good for
a sow as a pancake; these were dainties that could not but be acceptable
to the most squeamish stomachs; but now for rarities that must please
the gust of an emperor. The third and last course consisted of such
spiritual nutriment, that the nicest palated soul on this side the
adamantine gates, without a surfeit, might subsist on to all eternity,
which was servâ€™d up to the table, in much greater order than any of the
foregoing part of the entertainment. In the first place, a dish of
metaphysical curds, swimming in the cream of eloquence, was brought to
the upper end of the table, by a devil in a long gown, upon which piece
of cookery <i>Lucifer</i> and the <i>Jesuit</i> fed very heartily. In the next
place a dish of picklâ€™d enthusiasms well pepperâ€™d with obstinancy, and
coverâ€™d with the vinegar of dissention, was handed to the board by a
meagre-facâ€™d devil in a little band and long cloak, which by abundance
of the company was highly approvâ€™d on. The third dish was a mess of
melancholy humdrums, mixâ€™d with sobs and sighs, and garnishâ€™d round with
blasphemy and nonsense, servâ€™d up with a she devil in <i>querpo-hood</i> and
green apron, which the whole assembly in general commended, and devourâ€™d
as greedily as a gang of <i>Welsh</i> drovers would do a mess of
leek-porridge, or a dish of cows bubby. When every soul had fed
plentifully, and refreshâ€™d his immortality with a chearful dose of
spirit of sulphur, I, quoth the fool, for the jestâ€™s sake, was appointed
to say grace after meat; and when I had dischargâ€™d the office of a
chaplain, as comical as I could, the guests staggerâ€™d away like so many
flusterâ€™d long tails from a <i>Kentish</i> feast, and so the solemnity was
ended.</p>

<p>I have little more news to communicate from these parts, only that
within these few months, we have had five or six thousand diabolical
spirits, returnâ€™d from their embassies in the upper world, who were many
years since commanded thither by prince <i>Lucifer</i>, to the assistance and
further<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_223">{223}</a></span> establishment of our party and opinion, and had every one of
them possessâ€™d themselves of good quarters, and lay snug in the bosoms
of our sanctified friends, but reported when they came back, that an old
trout-back apostate, who lately fell from quakerism to the church,
arming himself cap-a-pee with the armour of truth, took up the sword of
the gospel, and by downright dint of scripture and sound reason, made so
large a conquest over <i>Satan</i>â€™s subjects, that the devils were forcâ€™d to
quit their possessions, and leave great numbers of our friends to the
mercy of G&#8212;&#8212;d and their ecclesiastical enemies; but fresh recruits
are daily sent among you from these infernal territories, hoping in a
little time to recover our lost interest.</p>

<p>I would have troubled you a little further, but that <i>Lucifer</i> being put
in a merry mood by the pleasing news of your <i>European Differences</i>, has
orderâ€™d all his jesters to be in waiting, and you know, all princes upon
publick rejoycings at court, must have their fools as well as knaves, to
attend â€™em: so farewel.</p>

<p><i>James Naylor</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HY friends are all very much afflicted to hear that <i>Satan</i> the father
of the wicked, has laid violent hands upon thee, and has drawn thee out
of the light into the land of utter darkness; if the dross of the world,
that ungodly mammon, which tempts the unwary often into the sins of the
flesh and many other iniquities, would redeem thee from thy woful
prison, where nothing is to be heard but weeping, wailing and gnashing
of teeth, we would lend thee our assistance with all our hearts; but the
spirit within us has declarâ€™d the truth, and told us, that thy
unmerciful jaylor will take no bribe or bail, and that the debt thou art
in for, the world cannot pay, and therefore we all fear thou art
trapannâ€™d into a loathsome gaol from whence there is no redemption. We
thought the many persecutions thou underwentâ€™st for the l&#8212;dâ€™s sake in
this world, (<i>viz.</i>) as peeping throâ€™ the yoak of infamy, and losing thy
two members of attention. <i>Secondly</i>, for hug<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_224">{224}</a></span>ging the vagabonds
land-mark against the will of the spirit, and undergoing the rod of
correction. And, <i>Thirdly</i>, for suffering the clack of the spirit to be
bored throâ€™ with a hot wimble, for warranting thyself to be the true son
of thy father, would have been merits sufficient to have raisâ€™d thee
upon the pinnacle of mount <i>Sion</i>, and there to have fixed thee as a
standing evidence of the truth to all eternity; but since the spirit
within thee provâ€™d a lying spirit, that extinguished the light, and led
thee like a blind guide into the dark ways of destruction; we that were
the followers of thy false glimmerings, must forsake the errors, and
seek the lord by a more perfect illumination, for the false fading
<i>jack-a-lanthorn</i> which thou leftest among us, is burnâ€™d into the
socket, and now stinks in the nostrils of the righteous, far worse than
the dying snuff of a cotton-candle; besides, what spiritual pilgrim in
his progress to the land of the living, would follow a wicked
<i>Will-with-a-wisp</i>, who has led a friend before into dark ways, and
there left him to grope among the filthiness of sin and pricks of
conscience to all eternity? no, if we follow thy ways, we shall err like
strayâ€™d sheep, and be pounded by <i>Satan</i> for wandâ€™ring into the paths of
the wicked.</p>

<p>That the father of lies, upon thy first entrance into his wicked
habitation, should put thee into a foolâ€™s jacket, we do not much wonder,
for the painted marks of folly are <i>Satanâ€™s</i> gay livery, with which he
cloaths his wicked servants in this world as well as in his dominions;
for didst thou ever behold on earth the sons of darkness, who follow the
lust of the flesh, and delight in those pomps and vanities which the
inward man forbids our frail natures to pursue, but they always were
distinguishâ€™d by some gaudy badge, which discovered their pride, or
other infirmities? do not the high-priests of <i>Baal</i> wear lawn
coversluts, and their head journeymen red pokes upon their backs? do not
flatterers of princes wear badges on their breasts, and adorn their
spindle-shanks with glittering gimcracks? do not their lazy slaves wear
blue and yellow, that the world may know whose fools they are? do not
the blessers of their food wear silken ornaments dangling from their
proud necks to their ancles, that the publick may mistake them to be
wiser than their neighbours? do not the captains of the host hoop their
loins with golden sashes, and stick<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_225">{225}</a></span> feathers in their caps to fright
their foes with their finery? do not judges wear gowns of a crimson die,
and the great men of the law wear the skull-caps of knavery, with the
edges tippâ€™d with innocence, to deceive the vulgar? do not physicians
ride in coaches with the weapons of destruction tyâ€™d dangling at their
arses, as it they were hurrying on a full trot to kill and not recover
their patients? do not haughty vintners hypocritically tye on their blue
ensigns of humility, to cozen their customers into an opinion of their
lowliness? do not whoremongers and adulterers thatch their empty noddles
with whole thickets of whores-hair? and do not wanton women wear turrets
on their heads, and cover their tails with the bowels of the silk-worms?
do not drunkards wear red noses, knaves hawks eyes, and liars impudent
faces? in short, friend <i>Naylor</i>, most people upon earth have some badge
or other of <i>Satan</i>â€™s livery; even kings themselves wear purple, and the
whores of <i>Babylon</i> scarlet; therefore our friends are all of one
opinion, that since thou departedâ€™st so far from the light, as to suffer
wicked <i>Satan</i> to decoy thee into his trapsoul of eternal darkness, he
has done thee but justice to put thee into a foolâ€™s coat, that every
time thou art thoughtful of thy miserable confinement, thou mayâ€™st look
upon thy party-coloured livery, and cry with a pitiful voice, alas, what
a fool am I! which is all the comfort thy friends who are sorrowful for
thy condition, are able to administer unto thee at this immensurable
distance.</p>

<p>We are very glad to here that <i>Satan</i> is no niggard in his family, but
like a generous host, provides so plentiful a table for his numerous
guests: we thy Friends upon earth, have taken his infernal food into our
serious consideration, and have resolvâ€™d, <i>nemine contradicente</i>, to
lead a starving life upon earth, rather than enter his palace-gate to be
beholden to him for a dinner. We shewâ€™d thy bill of fare to our friend
<i>Roberts</i>, at the <i>White hart</i> in <i>Chancery-lane</i>, approvâ€™d by the
wicked men of the law, who love to profane their stomachs with fine
feeding, to be as nice a gratifier of luxurious palates as ever handled
ladle; and he declareth for truth, by the motion of the spirit, that
thoâ€™ he has often roasted a codâ€™s-head larded with bacon without tying
it upon the spit, boilâ€™d a pound of butter stuffâ€™d with anchovies
without melting it, grillia<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_226">{226}</a></span>doâ€™d jelly of harts-horn without dissolving
it, fryâ€™d a jackboot into incomparable tripe, stewâ€™d pebble-stones till
they have become as soft as stewâ€™d prunes, and has made good savoury
sauce with an addled egg and kitchin-stuff, yet he acknowledges himself
wholly ignorant how to dress any one dish thou hast mentioned in the
catalogue of thy dainties, and therefore desires thou wilt do him the
friendly kindness to acquaint us in the next letter, what sort of cook
<i>Satan</i> has got in his kitchin; and if he be a friend, whether thou
thinkâ€™st our friend <i>Coquus</i>â€™s wife maynâ€™t be admitted as his scullion,
in case she would become a servant in thy masterâ€™s family, for she is
grown so peevish, he is willing to part with her. So hoping thou wilt
give us an account the next opportunity, we rest thy, <i>Loving Friends</i>.</p>

Astrological judgment, of which, to show your honesty to the world, you
give them such lumping pennyworths, that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_227">{227}</a></span> have made the noble
science of Heaven-peeping as cheap to the publick, as boilâ€™d tripe in</i>
Fee-lane, <i>or bakâ€™d sheeps-head in your own element</i> Baldwinâ€™s-gardens.
<i>I am joyful to hear you are grown so great a proficient in the
celestial gimcracks; but indeed, when I first knew you a joyner at</i>
Oxford, <i>that usâ€™d to make cedar cases for close-stool pans, I thought
you as ingenious a mechanick in your way, as he that invented a
mouse-trap or a nut-cracker, but little thought then, you would have
laid down the plane and the hand-saw, of which you were an absolute
master, to take up</i> Albumazarâ€™<i>s weapons, the celestial globe and
compasses, to which you were a mere stranger: but however, Astrology
being a kind of liberal science all men I know are free to dive into the
mystery, from the whimsey headed scholar, to the strolling tinker;
therefore your leather-apron and glue-pot are no disparagement to your
pursuit of the seven wandring informers, any more than it is a scandal
to a mountebank to be first a fool, and then a travelling physician</i>.
Gadbury <i>we know was no more than a country botcher, before he was
admitted as a tenant into the twelve houses; and</i> Partridge <i>was no more
than a</i> London <i>cobler, before he was made running footman to the seven
planets; yet both these students in Astrology have arrivâ€™d, I hear, to
as great an eminency in their heavenly profession, as ever was acquired
by the famed Dr.</i> Saffold, <i>or his successor</i> Case, <i>by long study and
experience, in the noble arts of Poetry and Physick. Therefore why may
not that spurious issue of a Carpenter callâ€™d a Joiner, make as
legitimate an Astrologer, as profound a Conjurer, as infallible a
Fortune-teller, as the best of them; nay better, if he knows but to use
his tongue like a smoothing-plane, and can take down the roughness of
some peoples incredulity, then may he work them as he does his
deal-boards, till he has gluâ€™d or nailâ€™d them fast to his own interest.
These are the talents for which I hear you are famous above other
Astrologers, and that by downright dint of craft, pout and banter, you
have wheedled more money in your time out of chamber-maids,
cook-wenches, old bawds, midwives, nurses, and young strumpets, than
ever was got by the rug and leather, luck in a bag, or that in most
excellent juggle on the cards, callâ€™d</i> preaching the parson: <i>nay if all
the gains that you have made of these three profitable inventions were
to be joinâ€™d together; besides a whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_228">{228}</a></span> mustard-pot full of
broad-pieces, a drudging-box full of guineas, a meal-tub full of crowns
and half crowns, and an old powdering-tub full of shillings and
sixpences, which lie parcelâ€™d up in your own house, I hear that you have
several hundreds of pounds in the</i> Stationers <i>company, which, besides
the interest of the money, entitles you every year to four good dinners
in the hall, as many noddles full of rare claret, and four pockets full
of venison-pasty for your female deputy, who is said to be a notable
understrapper to you in the business of Astrology, and is of as much
service to you as a second to a merry-andrew, for without the one, the
other could do nothing</i>.</p>

<p><i>I cannot but highly approve of the method I observe in your almanacks,
for since you write every year four</i>, i. e. <i>three in other persons
names, and one in your own, you have wisely projected a way to be
infallibly right in your predictions of the weather, which are commonly
varied under no more than four several denominations in any one of the
four seasons; so that by making your prognostications in every almanack
different, one must certainly tell right, and by keeping all four in
your pocket, which I am informâ€™d you have cunning enough to take care
of, by plucking out that which you know is agreeable and falls right,
declaring yourself to be the author, you gain reputation, and by this
juggle make some fools in your company believe that you have the stars
at more command, than a Haberdasher of dead bodies has his linkmen at a
funeral. This piece of cunning none of the celestial fraternity can
justly blame you for, every artist well knowing a juggler and an
astrologer are as inseperable companions as a bawd and a midwife, or a
lawyer and a knave, for either without the other, like an adjective
without a substantive, would be unable to stand by himself.</i></p>

<p><i>Of all the almanacks that are extant, none are so valuable in these
subterranean regions as your own; few hawkers travel into these parts
but they bring whole baskets full along with them, and the cry of</i>
Cooleyâ€™<i>s almanack for two months in the year, is as universally bawlâ€™d
about hellâ€™s metropolis, as mackrel among you when they come to be six a
groat, or</i> Chichester <i>lobsters when they stink at midsummer. Of all
the</i> almanacks <i>brought among us, prince</i> Lucifer <i>gives yours the
preference and never goes without one in his pocket, to put him in mind
of an</i> Holy Rood <i>day, that his devilship<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_229">{229}</a></span> may not lose his nutting
time. Your last</i> English merlin <i>but one, wanted of the four cardinal
points, for which piece of forgetfulness, the devil in a great rage
cryâ€™d he owâ€™d you a shame, and I was since informâ€™d, that one of our
infernal plenipotentiaries upon earth dischargâ€™d his masterâ€™s promise in
a short time after, at the</i> Darby <i>alehouse in</i> Fulwoodâ€™s <i>rents; by the
same token, the liquor had so eclipsâ€™d your distinguishing faculties,
that instead of a tankard of warm ale, that stood by you, you took hold
of the candlestick, and in a drinking posture conveyâ€™d the lighted
candle to your mouth, the taste of which was so intolerable to your
lips, that you flung it away in a great passion, believing â€™twas the
tankard of drink, and swore the bitch of a wench had made it so scalding
hot there was no drinking it. This unhappy accident occasionâ€™d some
ill-naturâ€™d people to reflect on you, and say, how should you know a
star from a kite-lanthorn, that could not distinguish between a tankard
of warm ale and a lighted candle?</i></p>

<p><i>I have no news from these parts that can be welcome to a man of your
gravity and profession. As for astrologers, they are no more regarded in
this kingdom, than an honest man in your world, or a modest woman in a
theatre, for the best employment that most of them aspire to here, is to
carry a closestool-pan upon their back after a quack-doctor, which
savory receptacle being put in a square case, makes our fraternity look
like so many raree-show men loaded with their boxes of dancing baubles.</i></p>

<p><i>I must confess, doctor</i> Saffold, <i>that famous student in physick,
poetry and astrology, whose verse was as good an emetick, as his pills
were a purge, being</i> Luciferâ€™<i>s peculiar favourite, was advancâ€™d to the
dignity of being flea catcher to his royal consort; but the other day
had like to have lost his place, by chasing one of his ladyâ€™s little
enemies into her</i> mount of Venus, <i>and beating the bush to start the
game, was so wonderfully pleasâ€™d at the pastime, that the old fool could
not forbear laughing, which ill manners so inflamâ€™d the infernal
duchess, that she vowâ€™d, except he would down on his knees and kiss what
he laughâ€™d at, she would never forgive him; upon which the poor doctor
was forcâ€™d to join beards, or else would have been turned out, to his
eternal shame as well as misery</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_230">{230}</a></span></p>

<p>Albumazar <i>and</i> Ptolomy <i>are set up like the two loggerheads at St.</i>
Dunstanâ€™<i>s church, and once in an hundred years they strike upon an huge
bell the number of the centuries from the fall of</i> Lucifer, <i>that the
devils and the damnâ€™d may know how eternity passes; for you must
imagine, as a quarter of an hour is to the time of your world, so is an
hundred years to the eternity of ours, every watch goes here at least
ten thousand years with but one winding up, for their movements, like
our form and substance, are all spiritual, and the worst artist we have
among us, your</i> Fleetstreet Tompion <i>is but a mere blacksmith to; as for
my own part, I trudgâ€™d for the first six months after Dr.</i> Ponteus,
<i>with a steeple-crownâ€™d conveniency, as I mentioned before, but having
always such a stink of</i> devilâ€™s-dung <i>in my nostrils, I petitioned for a
remove, and was admitted to be a yeoman of the bason to</i> Luciferâ€™<i>s
cloven-hoofs, to pick, wash, and refresh them after his return from
earth, which he visits very often for the preservation of his interest
in the upper world; and the worst inconveniency I find is, that his
worshipâ€™s feet smell worse after much walking than a sweating negroâ€™s</i>.</p>

<p><i>But, however, my old friend, let not this discourse discourage you from
venturing to come among us, or frighten you into a repentance of your
frauds and subtilties, that may carry you another way; for a man of your
merits, learnâ€™d in Astrology from the very nose of the</i> great bear, <i>to
the extreme point of the</i> dragonâ€™s tail, <i>and skilful in the
Mathematicks, from the mensuration of a surface to the most profound
nicety in solid Geometry, need not question, but that your old

reason enough left plainly to discern I am very much affronted in your
ironical letter: as for my part, Mr. mean it as you please, I take it in
good earnest, for it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_231">{231}</a></span> consistent with my temper and gravity at
these years, to like such unmannerly jesting. Time was, I was a young
fellow, that would have scolded with a butter-whore, boxâ€™d a carman, or
have scribled scurrilously with any</i> Lilly <i>in the universe; but, alas!
when a man has livâ€™d in this world to the age of near seventy, and has
had familiar conversation with all the foolish women in the town,
puzzled his brains with more angles, circles, squares, pentagons,
hexagons, heptagons, and parallellopipedons</i>, &amp;c. <i>than ever has been
yet found in that most famous introduction to the mathematicks, callâ€™d</i>
Euclidâ€™s Gimcracks, <i>pourâ€™d as much</i> Derby <i>ale throâ€™ his guts every

done with discord, and begin to compose himself into a little harmony;
therefore I take it ill you should attack me in my old age, especially
when you have Hell on your side, and the devil and all to help you</i>.</p>

<p><i>What, thoâ€™ I was a joiner at</i> Oxford, <i>and once to shew myself a good
workman, made a cedar close-stool case for the dean of</i> Christ-Church,
<i>I question not but one time or other for the excellency of its work, it
will be carried into the library, and be there preservâ€™d as a monument
of its makerâ€™s glory to all succeeding ages, when you will have no
remains to put the world in mind of you, but your old conjuring
countenance, painted upon a sign, and hung up over</i> Black-friers
<i>gateway, subscribed with a little paultry poetry, fit for no bodyâ€™s
reading but a parcel of country hobbies, who have left the plow and the
flayl, to come up to</i> London <i>to be cozenâ€™d out of the fruits of their
labour. It is well known, I was born and educated in a learned air, and
thoâ€™ a man be bred a cobler in that climate, he cannot help being a
scholar, if he but furnishâ€™d with as much brains as will fill a
cockleshell. I confess, I have not had the honour to be entered of a
college, yet by my own chamber-study, without a tutor, having a good
natural genius, I could tell you how many parts of speech there were, by
that time I was eighteen years of age; and I will appeal to the world,
who may judge by my conversation, whether I have not made a wonderful
advancement within these 50 years, insomuch that you may see I dare
write</i> Philomath, <i>in the very title page of my almanack; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_232">{232}</a></span>
therefore, Mr. am not to be banterâ€™d at these years. You have the
confidence, in several parts of your letter to call me conjurer, thoâ€™ I
must tell you, Mr. by the way, you are the first person that ever
thought me so. â€™Tis true, I do sometimes when I am well paid for it,
erect a scheme in search of lost goods, or strayâ€™d cattle, and do
presume</i> secundum artem, <i>to send the querent east, west, north, or
south, a mile or two distance from the loserâ€™s house, to search within
six doors of the sign of the four-footed beast, and if they cannot find
the thief one way, I can send them as far another for a new fee; and all
this I can justify by the rules of Astrology as well as any man; but
must an artist for this be called a conjurer, and by a person too who
has been a professor of the same science? Indeed, old acquaintance, I
take it very unkindly, because you yourself must needs know we are
honest men that deserve no such character. As for my mistaking the
lighted candle for a tankard of hot ale, I remember nothing of the
matter; but</i> Bacchus <i>thoâ€™ he be no planet, yet all men know he has a
great ascendency over us mortals, and what he might influence me to do,
when the light of reason, by which we see to distinguish, was eclipsed,
I know not; but I am morally sure, when my senses are about me I am not
easily to be so deceived; for I presume to know a pig from a dog, or the
difference between a Thing and cartwheel, as well as</i> Ptolomy <i>himself
were he now living</i>.</p>

<p><i>You say, to my reputation, that my almanacks sell beyond any bodyâ€™s in
your subterranean country, and that</i> Lucifer <i>himself is never without
one in his pocket: I am very glad to hear he is so much my friend, as to
give mine the preference, and for his civility intend to send him one

hand of some friend or other, that shall swim in</i> Derby <i>ale to the very

shower of rain to your drowthy dominions. The pleasing news you have
sent me is, that my works are so vendible in your parts, for I assure
you, upon your intelligence, I shall raise the price of my copy the next
year; for if my almanacks sell as well in hell as they do upon earth, I
am sure the company of</i> Stationers <i>must get the devil and all by them.

<p><i>Brother</i> Cave,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">C</span>Onsidering how often you have jested in the grave to please <i>Betterton</i>
prince of <i>Denmark</i>, I wonder the grave by this day has not been in
earnest with you, that in process of time, when the churchyard vermin
have feasted themselves upon your cadaver, your own scull may become a
jest to some other grave-digger. I must confess when I left you, you
were a sociable sort of a drunkard, and pretty little peddling sort of a
whoremaster, but I hear since, you have droopâ€™d within a few years into
such a dispirited condition, that â€™tis as much as a plentiful dose of
the best canary can do to remove the hyppocon for a few minutes, that
you may entertain your friends with a little of your comick humour,
gracâ€™d with that agreeable smile that has always rendered what you say
delightful, and that it is not in the subtile power of intoxicating
<i>Nantz</i> to add new life to that decayâ€™d member, which has in a manner
taken leave of this world before the rest of your body; you have so
often been used to a grave in your life-time, that I think you never
wanted a <i>memento mori</i> to put you in mind of mortality: death sure can
be no surprize to a merry mortal, who has so often jested with him upon
the stage, and and I long to hear when the grinning skeleton shall shake
you by the hand, and say, <i>Come, old duke</i> Trinculo, <i>thy last sands are
running, thy ultimate moment is at hand, and the worms are gaping for
thee</i>. What a jocular answer you will make to the thin-jawâ€™d
executioner, for every comedian ought to die with a jest in his mouth to
preserve his memory, for if he makes not the audience laugh as he goes
off the stage, he forfeits his character, and his fame dies with his
body; therefore I would advise you to set your wits on work to prepare
yourself, that as you have always livâ€™d by repeating other peoples wit,
you may not make your exit like a fool, but show you have some remains
of your own juvenile sparklings to oblige the world with at your last
minute.</p>

<p>I hear the effects of your debaucheries are tumbled into your pedestals,
and make you walk with as much delibera<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">{234}</a></span>tion as Mr. <i>Cant</i> preaches;
when a man is once so founderâ€™d by the iniquity of his life, that his
full speed is no faster than a snailâ€™s gallop, and that his memory and
his members both equally fail him, it is full time that he was travellâ€™d
to his journeyâ€™s end; for with what comfort can a man live in the world
when it is grown weary of him? young men I know look upon you as
superannuated, and had rather see a deathâ€™s-head and an hour-glass in
their company, than see you make wry faces at your rheumatick twitches,
or hear you banter upon your old gouty pains, and the past causes
thereof between jest and earnest. When a man once comes to answer a
bawdy question over the bottle silently, that is, with a feignâ€™d simper
and a shake of the head, no body cares a fart for him, he is good for
nothing at those years, but, like <i>Solomon</i>â€™s proverbs, to let young men
foresee that worldly pleasures, when they come to be old, are but
<i>vanity and vexation of spirit</i>; and to stir up young women to despise
the impotency of old age, which their fumbling fathers in vain admonish
them to reverence. A young comedian is apt to make every body his jest;
but when arrivâ€™d at your years, himself becomes a jest to every body.
Youth gives an air to wit that renders it delightful, but for an old man
to pretend to talk wisely, is like a musicianâ€™s endeavouring to fumble
out a fine sonata upon a wind-broach, thoâ€™ the time be good, the
instrument is imperfect, and the organs want that sound which should
give a grace to the harmony. Some men at sixty, are apt to flatter
themselves in publick under the imbecilities of nature, and will
boastingly say, they can do every thing as well as they could at thirty;
but experienced women, who are the best judges of human decay, are too
sensible of their error, and, if modesty would give â€™em leave, could
easily demonstrate the difference. I thank my stars, I knew not by
experience the winter of old age, but made my exit in the beginning of
my autumn; but yet I found what nature at midsummer esteemâ€™d a pleasure,
was even then become a drudgery; and what used to be a refreshment to
life, was found but a slavish exercise to the body; therefore I heartily
pity your impotent condition, who has near twenty years survivâ€™d your
grand climateric, till thou art forcâ€™d to crawl about the world with a
load of diseasâ€™d flesh upon thy back, and art no less than a
sumpter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_235">{235}</a></span>-horse to thy own infirmities. Methinks I see thee creeping upon
the surface of the earth, upon a feeble pair of gouty supporters, thy
loins swathâ€™d up in flannel, leaning upon a crutch-head cane, and
bending towards thy mother earth, who catches thee at every stumble,
sometimes reflecting on the past pleasures of human life, and sometimes
looking forward with imperfect eyes, towards the doubtful state of
immortality, grinning as you walk at the gaiety of youth, and snarling
in thy thoughts at those delights the weakness of thy age has put thee
past enjoying; pursuing only that pleasure, which thoâ€™ thy youth made
vicious, is in age become thy support; that is, the bottle, which in thy
younger days was oft made nauseous by excess; but wise experience now
has taught thee sure to make the darling comfortable by a seasonable
moderation: methinks I see thee use it now with caution, as if you hopâ€™d
by every glass you drank, to strengthen natureâ€™s union, and keep your
soul and body still from separation.</p>

<p>The ghost of a comedian in these shades is but an useless piece of
immortality, for all the entertainments upon the stages of our infernal
theatres are very tragical, no smile, no merry looks, or monky gestures
usâ€™d by your merry-andrews upon earth to provoke your listning audience
to a laughter, are fashionable in these parts. If you intend to come
among us, you must learn to howl, to grin, and gnash your teeth, unless
you can make yourself so compleat a philosopher as to laugh at your own
misery. Horror, darkness, and despair oâ€™erspread the whole dominion, and
our tyrannical prince is never better pleasâ€™d than when he sees his
subjects the most miserable. As for my part, as merry a representative
of some foolish plebeian as I was in the upper world, I cannot in these
melancholy grottos for the heart of me, frame so much as one chearful
conceit to mitigate those torments, which by virtue of our diabolical
laws are perpetually inflicted upon me: therefore those who betake
themselves to these regions ought to arm themselves with abundance of
resolution; for whoever flinches beneath their pains, do but encrease
their punishment, for which reason I advise you to consider what you
have to trust to, if your journey be downwards; and if you find it in
your power, to divert your coming hither with prayers and tears to
heaven, or else I must tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_236">{236}</a></span> in good earnest, you may jest on as I

<p><i>Honest Friend</i> Tony,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>Hen I first read your letter, as merry as the world thinks me, I was
struck with such a terrible tremulation, that it was as much as three
gulps of my brandy-bottle could do to put my chillâ€™d blood into its
regular motion; I had no sooner recoverâ€™d myself, but thinking of death
and the devil, which I had scarce done in sixty years before, I fell
into such an extravagant fit of praying, that if any body had heard me,
they would sooner have guessâ€™d me, by the length of my devotion, to have
been a <i>Presbyterian</i> parson than duke <i>Trinculo</i> the comedian; it was
the first time that ever I found myself in earnest in my life, and I was
suddenly sensible of so vast a difference betwixt that and jesting, that
I believe for a whole hour together I was changâ€™d from an old comical
merry-andrew, into a new sorrowful penitent and was I to con over your
letter but once in a day, I believe it would go near to fright me into
abundance of religion, which we players, you are sensible, seldom or
never think on, except we are put in mind onâ€™t by some extraordinary
accident; and the main reason I believe why we are not over-burthenâ€™d
with zeal, is our drolling upon the clergy, by representing Mr.
<i>Spintext</i> the preacher, or Mr. <i>Lovelady</i> the chaplain, after a
ridiculous manner for the loose audience to laugh at; which we repeat so
often, till at last we are apt to fancy religion as well as the teachers
of it, to be really no more than what we make them, that is, a meer
jest, and worthy only to be smilâ€™d at and not to be listenâ€™d to.</p>

<p>Certainly you have a very good intelligence in your world, of the
circumstances of us who dwell above you, or else you are the devil of a
guesser, for you seem in your letter, to have as true a sense of my
condition as if you were an eye-witness of it; for to tell you the truth
on it, I find all the members of my body in such a fumbling condition,
that I begin to think of a leap in the dark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_237">{237}</a></span> and to wonder what in a
little time will become of me; the people are still pleasâ€™d to see me
crawl upon the stage; indeed the shuffling pace that age and decay hath
brought me to, makes the audience as merry as if it were a counterfeit
gesture to provoke laughter; but, iâ€™faith, brother <i>Tony</i>, that which
makes them glad makes me sad, insomuch, that my heart has aked every
time these five years, when I have playâ€™d the sexton in <i>Hamlet</i>, for
fear when I am once got into the grave, the grim tyrant should give me a
turn over the perch, and keep me there for jesting with mortality.</p>

<p>Nature, which finds herself declining in me, is so greedy of new breath,
that I gape as I crawl for the benefit of the fresh air, as if I was
jaw-fallen, and those humming insects that are a pestiferous calamity
this hot weather to all cooks-shops and sugar-bakers, are so unmannerly,
that they fly over those few palisadoes of my breathing-hole that are
left, and dung tâ€™other side the pails, as if they took my mouth for a
house of office; nay, sometimes in creeping along the length of a
street, I have had my tongue so fly-blown, that had I not gone into a
tavern and washâ€™d them off with a pint of canary, I donâ€™t know, but my
whole head might have been as full of maggots in a little time, as a
sheepâ€™s arse at <i>Midsummer</i>.</p>

<p>I find the greatest curse of my old age is, my desire surviving my
capacity, for I protest, my inclinations are as youthful as ever, thoâ€™
my ability is quite superannuated.</p>

<p>I am just now entring into a fit of the gout, which so terrifies me,
that I pray one half minute, and curse the other, like a true bred
seaman in a storm, therefore am forcâ€™d to break off, blood and wounds,
abruptly.</p>

honesty and integrity enough to qualify you for a bishop; I took you a
meer bumkin, and taught you your trade for a basket of turky-eggs, and
therefore it highly concerns your prudence to consider the obligation
you lie under of carrying yourself to the world with all humility, thoâ€™
aspirâ€™d to the very pinnacle of prosperity, since the first cause of
your advancement droppâ€™d out of the fundament of a turkey: the eggs, as
an argument of their being new laid, I remember were besmeared with
excrementitious tokens of good luck, which make me fancy, when I
received them, they were beshitten omens of your future fortune, in
whose behalf they were presented me.</p>

<p>Birds have often shewâ€™d their tenderness and compassion to mankind:
eagles have preservâ€™d infants in their nests, who have afterwards become
singularly prosperous in the ages they have livâ€™d in. <i>Sappho</i> raisâ€™d
himself to the reputation of a God among the <i>Persians</i> by parrots, and
yourself to the grandeur of an alderman by your motherâ€™s hen turkies:
for in all wonderful effects the leading cause ought to be reverencâ€™d
and respected.</p>

<p>Nothing conduces more to the rise and riches of a citizen, than these
three qualifications; nor can a man be a compleat trader without them:
<i>First</i>, To be a hypocrite undiscernably: <i>Secondly</i>, A knave, and not
mistrusted: And <i>Thirdly</i>, To be diligent in all matters that concern
his own interest. These profitable talents I must needs confess you are
absolute master of, and managed them with that admirable cunning, that I
always conceivâ€™d a different opinion of you, till I had given it
irrevocably into your power to feather your own nest, by compleating of
my ruin; and like a true politician (I thank you) you made an excellent
use of the lucky opportunity: for when the vicissitude of fortune had
put my affairs in a little disorder, and I thought it best for the
safety of my person to take foreign sanctuary, what friendly protections
did you make, from the teeth outwards, of the faithful service<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_239">{239}</a></span> you
would do me in my absence, in order to compose and settle matters after
such a manner, that all the difficulties should be removâ€™d and made
easy, that had lessenâ€™d my credit, and occasionâ€™d me to withdraw? Upon
which, I being too forward to believe a person, I had raisâ€™d from
sheep-skin breeches, and leathern shoe-ties, to the substance and
reputation of a topping citizen, could never forget the obligation he
lay under to do me justice, as to prove treacherous to his master,
trusted you alone with my whole effects, and the sole power of managing
my affairs according to your own discretion: but you, like a faithful
steward, when my back was turnâ€™d, instead of endeavouring to support my
declining reputation, lessenâ€™d my circumstances to my creditors far
beneath their real estimate, till you had bought up my notes to the sum
of a hundred thousand pounds, for an eighth part of their value, on your
own behalf, with the ready specie I had left you to compound my matters;
and like an honest man returnâ€™d them upon me at their full contents,
cheating my creditors of seven parts in eight of their due, sinking the
money to yourself, and leaving, like an ungrateful wretch, the kindest
of all masters to die a beggar; in this, I say, you shewâ€™d yourself a
compleat citizen: <i>First</i>, A hypocrite in dissembling friendship to me:
<i>Secondly</i>, A knave, in cheating me and my creditors; And <i>Thirdly</i>, An
industrious man, in diligently converting so fair an opportunity so
foully to your own interest.</p>

<p>Upon this basis (when downright knavery, according to the city phrase
was termâ€™d outwitting) you raisâ€™d a popular esteem to yourself for being
a wealthy man, and a cunning one, and as I have since heard, daily
improvâ€™d your riches as honestly as you got it; and by changing broad
money into less, made your sums the larger: a pretty sort of a paradox,
that a man by diminution should raise an increase: but the deed was
darker than the saying, yet both very intelligible to moneyâ€™d citizens
in the age you live in. It is no great wonder, if rightly considerâ€™d,
that a man of your dealing should acquire such vast riches, since you
were so well belovâ€™d by your under agents, that scarce a sessions pass
for seven years together, but one or other was hanged for the
propagation of your interest, whilst yourself stood secure behind a
bulwark of full bags,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_240">{240}</a></span> that skreenâ€™d your person from the law, and your
reputation from the danger of common slander.</p>

<p>Another fortunate opportunity you had of heaping more muck upon your
fertile possessions, and manuring those mighty sums you had before
collected, was the misfortunes of your prince, which largely contributed
(as you honestly orderâ€™d the matter) to your further prosperity.
Fourscore thousand pounds more added to your preceeding stock, was,
indeed, enough to make a reasonable man contented; but as nothing less
than the conquest of the whole world could satisfy the ambition of
<i>Alexander</i>; so nothing, I am apt to think, but the riches of the
universe, can quench the unbounded avarice of so aspiring a <i>CrÅ“sus</i>.
But oh the disappointments that attend the proud and wealthy! what
signifies three hundred thousand pounds to an ambitious alderman, if he
cannot take a peaceable nod in his elbow-chair of state, and be
registered in the city-annals, lord-mayor of <i>London</i>, that posterity
may read <i>Duncombe</i> and his turkies were as much renowned in the age
they livâ€™d in, as <i>Whittington</i> and his cat? I am heartily sorry (since
fortuneâ€™s favours, and your own indefatigable knavery, have so happily
concurrâ€™d to make you rich) that the electors of the city would not also
agree to make you honourable; and that your oracle of time, that publick
monument of your generosity, with your promise of a mansion-house for
the city-magistrate, and the twelve apostles to be elevated at the
east-end of St. <i>Paul</i>â€™s, will not all prevail upon the livery-men of
<i>London</i> to chuse you into the trust and dignity, which would very
highly become a person of your worth, honour, and integrity. But, as I
well remember, one of the eggs was rotten, which I have since reflected
on, and think it reasonable to judge, if there be any divination by
eggs, that it predicted your hopes would be addled in this very affair;
and do therefore advise you for the future, to decline all thoughts of
the mayoralty. I am very well pleasâ€™d that you deal barefacâ€™d to the
world in one particular, which is, that thoâ€™ you keep a chaplain in your
house to feed your ears with a few mincâ€™d instructions, yet you
entertain two mistresses publickly in your family, to reduce the
rebellious flesh into an orderly subjection; from whence your neighbours
may see, in matters of religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_241">{241}</a></span> you are no hypocrite, but openly do
that which more secret sinners would be ashamâ€™d to be caught in, who
perhaps are full as wicked, thoâ€™ they hide their vices with a sanctifyâ€™d
coverslut, whilst you professing not much religion, scorn to make so ill
a use as a cloak, of that little you are blessâ€™d with.</p>

<p>I fear you are grown too bulky in estate to be long-livâ€™d in prosperity,
you are a well-fed fish to be caught nibbling at the bait, and abundance
of great men are angling for you; if you are once hamperâ€™d by the hook,
you will not shake yourself off easily: and methinks itâ€™s pity a man
that, I have some reason to say, has got an estate knavishly, should
ever run the hazard of losing it foolishly; but preserve it according to
the custom of the city, to build an alms-house after your decease, that
may maintain about the thousandth part of as many people when he is
dead, as he has cheated when he was living.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Answer_to_Alderman_Blackwell"></a><i>The Answer to Alderman</i> <span class="smcap">Blackwell</span>.</h2>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>HO would ever be a servant, if it were not for the hopes of being at
one time or other as good a man as his master? Itâ€™s the thoughts of
bettering our own conditions without danger, that makes a man submit
with patience to a servile subjection: but he that can govern his
master, will never truly obey him; and he that finds he can outwit him,
will be no longer his fool. Nature made us freemen alike, and gave us
the whole world to seek our fortunes in; and he that by either wit,
strength or industry, can straddle over the back of another, has the
riding him for his pains. If one man that is poor, worms a rich man out
of his estate, it is but changing condition with one another, and the
world in general is not a jot the worse for it: besides, in most mens
opinions, he best deserves an estate that has cunning enough to get one,
and wit enough to keep it when he has got it. I know no inju<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_242">{242}</a></span>stice but
what is punishable by the laws of the land; and if I can acquire an
estate, thoâ€™ fifty men starve for it, that the laws will protect me in,
I think myself as rightfully possessâ€™d as any man in the kingdom: he
that is bubbled out of an estate will certainly fall under the character
of a fool; and he that gets one will be as surely suspected for a knave;
no man enjoys the reputation of an honest man, but he who bribes the
world by courtesies into that opinion of him; and he who, like myself,
scorns to be at the charge of purchasing onâ€™t, shall be sure never to
enjoy the character. Honesty and courage may be said to stand upon one
bottom, for all men would derogate from both, and be knaves and cowards
if they durst; for its the fear of being pissâ€™d upon by every body, that
makes men fight soberly; and the fear of punishment that makes men live
honestly; yet a politick coward often passes for a brave man for want of
being tryâ€™d; and an arrant knave, for want of opportunity for a very
honest fellow.</p>

<p>You blame me for building my own welfare out of your ruin, and charge me
with knavery for taking the advantage of your folly; I am of that old
opinion, that all mankind are either fools or knaves; and it is a maxim
in my politicks, that he who will not be a knave, the world will make a
fool of him. One manâ€™s oversight is always anotherâ€™s gain. How then can
you condemn me for laying hold of that opportunity, which your weakness
gave me as a tryal of my wit? and had I neglected making a true use of
it to my own advantage, I had made myself a greater fool than he who
trusted a single manâ€™s honesty with so large a temptation. Could you
have kept your estate in your own power, how great was your indiscretion
to deliver it into mine? and since I found, when I had it in my custody,
I could secure it to myself, beyond the power of the law to recover it,
how foolish shouâ€™d I have been to have omitted the opportunity? in
short, I am very well satisfyed at the usage I gave you, no check of
conscience do I yet find that inclines me to repentance; but am heartily
resolvâ€™d, throâ€™ the course of my life, never to let slip so luscious an
advantage.</p>

<p>As for my sorting of broad-money for the royal snippers, it was grown so
universal a practice among all dealers, that it ceasâ€™d from being
thought criminal, and became a pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_243">{243}</a></span>fitable trade; and I never was so
lazy in my life, as to suffer any project to be on foot, wherein money
was to be got, but I always had a hand inâ€™t. The <i>Hollanders</i> clippâ€™d it
openly in their shops, and passâ€™d it afterwards among us. And shall we
suffer a foreign nation to ingross that advantage to themselves, which
was doubtless rather the property of a true-born <i>Englishman</i> to enjoy?
no I am a true lover of my country, and do assert, itâ€™s better to be
rogues among our selves, and cozen one another, than it is to be cheated
in our own way by a pack of knavish neighbours.</p>

<p>As for my master king <i>James</i>, I dealt honestly by him as long as he
continued my customer; but truly when his credit was sunk, and he was
forcâ€™d to take sanctuary in a foreign country, my conscience told me
â€™twas the safest way, even to serve my prince as I had done you my
master; for indeed, I could not reasonably think; providence flung so
many lucky hits in a manâ€™s way for him to make no use of; besides, what
signifies cozening a king of a trifling sum of fourscore thousand pound,
when he was going into a country where every body knew he would be well
provided for? I considerâ€™d it would do me more kindness by half; and
thoâ€™ some of his friends blamâ€™d me, yet I thought myself an honester man
by much, than those who strippâ€™d him of his sovereignty; for if it was a
sin to cheat him at all, then those who cheated him most were doubtless
the most wicked; and to deal with you like an old friend, without
dissimulation, as long as I can imagine thereâ€™s a man upon earth more
sinful than myself I have a conscience that can fling nothing in my
face, but what I can withstand boldly without blushing.</p>

<p>You seem to highly reflect upon me for keeping two domestick
conveniences publickly in my family, as if a man of my grandeur should
abridge himself of those pleasures which every apprentice-boy has the
enjoyment of between the mistress and the maid, without stirring over
the threshold; and sure an Alderman in the city, a grave magistrate, a
man worth three hundred thousand pounds, need not be either afraid or
ashamâ€™d of being suspected guilty of that little sniveling sin practisâ€™d
daily in every citizenâ€™s house, from the very beds in the garret, down
to the stools in the kitchen. Why, at that rate you would muzzle ones
appetite, a man had better by half be a pres<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_244">{244}</a></span>byterian parson, and have
two or three pair of holy sisters to smuggle over every week, than to be
an alderman of the city of <i>London</i>, and have his carnal inclinations
priest-ridden with a curb-bridle.</p>

<p>As for the fair promises I made to the city in order to have coaksâ€™d
them to have chose me mayor, I designâ€™d them only as alluring baits to
tempt the godly party over to my interest, and in the common hall it
took very good effect; but had I once got into the chair, I should have
shewâ€™d them a trick like Sir <i>Timber Temple</i>, and have reducâ€™d my
mountain-promise into a mole-hill performance; which our cunning
fraternity mistrusting (for always set a knave to catch a knave) by a
piece of unpracticable subtilty they threw me out, when I thought myself
as cock-sure of the honour as a man is of a morsel he has got in his
mouth: but the city is so corrupted, that an honest church-man can put
no confidence in a parcel of knavish fanaticks, but he is sure to be
deceivâ€™d. Had the church party been strong enough to have brought me in,
I had then caught what I gapâ€™d for, as sure as thereâ€™s a cuckhold in
<i>Guild-Hall</i> in the time of election: but knowing our court of wiseakers
was at that time under the ascendency of a whiggish planet, I was
fearful I should lose it; but they had better have chose me, for I
assure them, I would sooner go into <i>Barbary</i> and feed ostriches with my
money, than I would lay out one groat towards so much as the repairing
of one of their old gates, or in adding any thing to the cityâ€™s
magnificence, thoâ€™ â€™twas no more than a weather-cock: nay I have now so
little charity for that ingrateful <i>Sodom</i>, that I would not be at the
expence of giving them an engine, tho I was sure â€™twould save them a
second conflagration.</p>

<p>I fear, Sir, by this time I have quite tired your patience, and shall
therefore conclude with this acknowledgment, that I livâ€™d under one of
the best princes in the world, and one of the best masters in the
kingdom, and that under both, I thank my stars, I have patchâ€™d up a
pretty good fortune, and I profess, as I am a christian of the true
church by law establishâ€™d, I would turn subject to the <i>Grand Seignior</i>,
and servant to alderman <i>Lucifer</i>, to enjoy again two such precious
opportunities. <i>So I rest, with a quiet Conscience, your thankful
Servant</i>,</p>

<p><i>Dear Friend</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>O tell you the truth, I send you this letter on purpose to undeceive
you; I know that the upper world has a notion, that these infernal
shades are destitute of all harmony, and delight in nothing but jarring,
discord, and confusion; upon the word of a musician, you are all
mistaken, for I never came into a merrier country, since I knew a whimsy
from a fiddle-stick; every body here sings as naturally as a
nightingale, and at least as sweet. Lovers sit perchâ€™d upon bows by
pairs, like murmuring turtles in a rural grove, and in amorous ditties
sing forth their passionate affections; all people on this side the
adamantine gates have their organs perfect, and <i>I burn, I burn, I
burn</i>, which some persons thought a critical song upon earth, is here
sung by every scoundrel: the whole infernal territory is infested with
such innumerable crowds of poets and musicians, that a man canâ€™t stir
twice his length, but he shall tread upon a new ballad; and as for
musick, â€™tis so plenty amongst us, that a fellow shall be scraping upon
a fiddle at every garret-window, and another tinkling a spinet, or a
virginal, in every chimney-corner; flutes, hautboys and trumpets are so
perpetually tooting, that all the year round the whole dominion is like
a <i>Bartholomew-Fair</i>; and as for drums, you have a set of them under
every devilâ€™s window, rattling and thumping like a consort of his
majestyâ€™s rat-tat-tooâ€™s at an <i>English</i> wedding: we have such a glut of
all sorts of performers, that our very ears are surfeited; and any body
may hire a consort for a day, large enough to surround
<i>Westminster-Abbey</i>, for the price of an hundred of chesnuts; yet every
minstrel performs to admiration. Every cobler here that dispatches a
voluntary whilst heâ€™s waxing his thread, shall out-sing Mr. <i>Abel</i>, and
a carpenter shall make better musick upon an empty cupboard strung with
five brass-wires, than <i>Baptist</i> can upon the harpsichord; every trumpet
that attends a botkin lottery, sounds better than <i>Shore</i>; and not a
porter here plies at the corner of a street, but with his stubbed
fingers, can make a smooth<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_246">{246}</a></span> table out grunt the harmony of a double
curtel. We have catches too in admirable perfection: Fish-women sit and
sing them at market, instead of scolding as they do at <i>Billingsgate</i>;
hymns and anthems are as frequent among us as among you of the upper
world; for to every church God Almighty has on earth, here the devil has
a chapel.</p>

<p>You are sensible I was a great lover of musick before I departed my
temporal life, but now I am so surfeited with incessant sound, that I
would rather chuse to be as deaf as an adder, than be plaguâ€™d with the
best <i>ayre</i> that ever <i>Corelli</i> made, or the finest <i>sola</i> or <i>sonata</i>
that ever was composâ€™d in <i>Italy</i>: for you must know the laws of this
country are such, that every man, for sins in the other world, shall
here be punishâ€™d with excess of that which he there esteemâ€™d most
pleasant and delightful. Lovers, that in your region would hang, or
drown, or run throâ€™ fire like a couple of salamanders for one anotherâ€™s
company, are here coupled together like the twins <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>,
pursuant to their own wishes upon earth, and have all the liberty they
can desire with one another, but must never be separated whilst eternity
endures. This sort of confinement, thoâ€™ â€™tis what they once coveted,
makes them so sick of one another in a little time, that they cry out, O
damnable slavery! O diabolical matrimony! and are always drawing two
several ways with all imaginable hatred, endeavouring, to break their
fetters, and pursue variety; thus every one is wedded to what they like
best, and yet every personâ€™s desires teminate in their own misery, which
sufficiently shews there is no other justice to punish us for our
follies, than the objects of our own loose appetites and inclinations;
for that which we are apt to covet most when we are in the upper world,
generally, if obtainâ€™d, proves our greatest unhappiness; therefore,
since experience would not teach us to bridle our inclinations on the
other side the grave, the pleasures we pursued when we were living, are,
after death, appointed to be our punishments.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Stag&#8212;&#8212;s</i>, is greatly improved since he arrived in these parts,
and has more crotches flow throâ€™ his brains in one minute, than he can
digest into musick in a whole week; he had not been here a month, but
his bandy<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_247">{247}</a></span>legs steppâ€™d into a very good place, and his business is to
compose <i>Scotch</i> tunes for <i>Lucifer</i>â€™s bag-piper. Honest <i>Tom Farmer</i>
has taken such an antipathy against musick, upon hearing a <i>French</i>
barber play <i>Banister</i>â€™s ground in <i>Bmi</i>, upon a jews-trump, that he
swears that the hooping of a tub, and filing of a saw, makes the
sweetest harmony in christendom; <i>Robin Smith</i>, is still as love-mad as
ever he was; hangs half a dozen fiddles at his girdle, as the fellow
does coney-skins, and scours up and down hell, crying a <i>Reevs</i>, a
<i>Reevs</i>, as is the devil was in him. Poor <i>Val Redding</i> too, is quite
tired with his lyre-way-fiddle, and has betaken himself to be a
merry-andrew to a <i>Dutch</i> mountebank; and the reason he gave for it was
this, That he was got into a country where he found fools were more
respected than fiddlers. Dancing-masters are also as numerous in every
street, as posts in <i>Cheapside</i>, there is no walking but we must stumble
upon them; they are held here but in very slight esteem, for the gentry
call them leg-livers, and the mob from their mighty number, and their
nimbleness, call them the devilâ€™s grass-hoppers. Players run up and down
muttering of old speeches, like so many madmen in their own soliloquies;
and if any beau wants a bridge to bear him over a dirty channel, a
player lies down instead of a plank, for him to walk over upon; the
reason why they were doomâ€™d to that piece of scandalous servitude, was,
because they were as proud upon the stage as the very princes they
represented; and as humble in a brandy-shop, as a scold in a
ducking-stool; therefore were fit for nothing when they had done
playing, but to be trampled upon. I have nothing further at present to
impart to you, so begging you to excuse this trouble, <i>I rest</i>,</p>

<p><i>Dear Friend</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OUR letter was one of the greatest surprises to me, I ever met with;
for after giving credit to that ful<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">{248}</a></span>some piece of flattery, stuck up by
some of your friends upon a pillar behind the organ, which you once were
master of, I remainâ€™d satisfiâ€™d you were gone to that happy place, where
your own harmony could only be exceeded, and had left order with some of
your friends to put up that epitaph only as a direction where your
acquaintance upon occasion might be sure to meet with you; but since you
have favourâ€™d me with a letter from your own hand, wherein you assure me
â€™twas your fortune to travel a quite contrary road, I will always be of
opinion for the future, that when a man takes a step in the dark, those
that he leaves behind him can no more guess where he is gone, than I can
tell whatâ€™s become of the saddle which <i>Balaam</i> rid upon when his ass
spoke; for I find just as people please or displease us in this world,
we accordingly assign them a place of happiness or unhappiness in the
next, virtue shall be rewarded, and vice punished hereafter, â€™tis true,
but when or how, I believe every man knows as well as the pope;
therefore, many people have blamâ€™d the inscription of your marble, and
think it a presumption in the pen-man to be so very positive in matters,
which the wisest of mankind, without death, can come to no true
knowledge of. The fanaticks especially are very highly offended at it,
and say, It looks as if a man could toot himself to heaven upon the
whore of <i>Babylon</i>â€™s bag-pipes, and that religion consists only in the
true setting of a catch, or composing of a madrigal. I have had many a
bitter squabble with them in defence of your epitaph, upon which they
scoffingly advisâ€™d me to get Monsieur <i>dâ€™Urfey</i> to tag it with rhime,
then myself to garnish it with a tune, and so make it a catch in
imitation of <i>Under this stone lies Gabriel John</i>, &amp;c. which unlucky
saying, so dum-founded me, that I was forcâ€™d silently to submit, because
you had servâ€™d another personâ€™s epitaph after the same manner.</p>

<p>I have no novelties to entertain you with relating to either the <i>Abbey</i>
or St. <i>Paul</i>â€™s, for both the choirs continue just as wicked as they
were when you left them; some of them daily come reeking hot out of the
bawdy-house into the church; and others stagger out of a tavern to
afternoon prayers, and hick up over a little of the <i>Litany</i>, and so
back again. Old <i>Claret-face</i> beats time still upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_249">{249}</a></span> his cushion
stoutly, and sits growling under his purple canopy, a hearty
old-fashionâ€™d base that deafens all about him. Beau <i>Bushy-whig</i>
preserves his voice to a miracle, charmes all the ladies over against
him with his handsome face; and all over head with his singing. Parson
<i>Punch</i> make a very good shift still, and lyricks over his part in an
anthem very handsomly. So much for the church, and now for the
play-houses, which are grown so abominably wicked since the pious
society have undertook to reform them, that not a member of the
fraternity will sit down to his dinner, till he has repeated over a
catalogue of curses upon the crew of sin-sucking hypocrites, as long as
a presbyterian grace, then falls to with a good appetite, and damns them
as heartily after dinner; nor will they bring a play upon the stage,
unless larded with half a dozen of luscious bawdy songs in contempt of
the reforming authority, some writ by Mr. <i>C</i>&#8212;&#8212; and set by your friend
Dr. <i>B</i>&#8212;&#8212;; others writ by Mr. <i>D</i>&#8212;&#8212;, and set by your friend Mr.
<i>E</i>&#8212;&#8212;: you know men of our profession hang between the church and the
play-house, as <i>Mahomet</i>â€™s tomb does between the two load-stones, and
must equally incline to both, because by both we are equally supported.</p>

<p>Religion is grown a stalking-horse to every bodies interest, and every
man chuses to be of that faith which he finds to be most profitable. Our
parochial-churches this hot weather are but indifferently fillâ€™d, but
our cathedrals are still crowded as they usâ€™d to be, because to one that
comes thither truly to serve God, fifty come purely to hear the musick;
the blessing of peace has again quite forsaken us, and the people tired
with being happy, have drawn the curse of war upon their own heads; and
the clergy, like true christians, confound their enemies heartily. Money
begins already to be as scarce as truth, honour and honesty; and a man
may walk from <i>Ludgate</i> to <i>Aldgate</i>, near high change-time, and not
meet a citizen with a full bag under his arm, or jot of plain-dealing in
his conscience. The ready specie lies all in the <i>Bank</i> and <i>Exchequer</i>,
and most traders estates lie in their pocket-books and their comb-cases:
paper goes current instead of cash, and pen and ink does us more service
than the mines in the <i>Indies</i>. I am very much in arrears upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_250">{250}</a></span>
account of my business, as well as the brethren of my quality; but
whether we shall be paid in this world or the next, we are none of us
yet certain. You made a timely step out of a troublesome world, could I
imagine you were got into a worse, I could easily pin my faith upon
impossibilities; but fare as you will, it cannot be long eâ€™er I shall
give you my company, and discover the truth of that which our priests
talk so much of, and know so little:</p>

<p><i>Madam</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Vow to Gad, lady, of all the fair sex that ever occupied their
faculties upon the publick stage, I think your pretty self the only
miracle! for a woman to cloak the frailties of nature with such
admirable cunning as you have done hitherto, merits, in my opinion, the
wonder and applause of the whole kingdom! how many chaste <i>Diana</i>â€™s in
your station have lost their reputation before they have done any thing
to deserve it! but for a woman of your quality first to surrender her
honour, and afterwards preserve her character, shows a discreet
management beyond the policy of a statesman: your appearance upon the
stage puts the court-ladies to the blush, when they reflect that a
mercenary player should be more renownâ€™d for her virtue, than all the
glorious train of fair spectators; who, like true women, hear your
praises whisperâ€™d with regret, and behold your person with insupportable
envy. The <i>Roman</i> empress <i>Messalina</i> was never half so famous for her
lust, as you are for your chastity; nor the most christian kingâ€™s
favourite, madam <i>Maintenon</i>, more eminent for her parts, than you are
for your cunning; for nothing is a greater manifestation of a womanâ€™s
conduct, than for her to be vicious without mistrust, and to gratify her
looser inclinations without discovery; at which sort of managements you
are an absolute artist, as since my de<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_251">{251}</a></span>parture I have made evident to
myself, by residing in those shades where the secrets of all are open;
for peeping by chance into the breast of your old acquaintance, where
his sins were as plainly scorâ€™d as tavern-reckonings upon a bare-board;
there did I behold, among his numberless transgressions, your name
registerâ€™d so often in the black list, that fornication with madam
B&#8212;&#8212; came so often into the score, that it seemâ€™d to me like a chorus at
the end of every stanza in an old ballad: besides had I wanted so
manifest a proof, as by chance I met with, experience has taught me to
judge of my own sex to a perfection, and I know the difference there is
between being really virtuous and only accounted so: I am sensible â€™tis
as hard a matter for a pretty woman to keep herself honest in a theatre,
as â€™tis for an apothecary to keep his treacle from the flies in hot
weather; for every libertine in the audience will be buzzing about her
honey-pot, and her virtue must defend itself by abundance of fly-flaps,
or those flesh-loving insects will soon blow upon her honour, and when
once she has had a maggot in her tail, all the pepper and salt in the
kingdom will scare keep her reputation from stinking; therefore that
which makes me admire your good housewifery, above all your sex, is,
that notwithstanding your powdering-tub, has been so often polluted, yet
you have kept your flesh in such credit and good order that the nicest
appetite in the town would be glad to make a meal of it.</p>

<p>You must excuse me, <i>Madam</i>, that I am thus free with you, for you know
â€™tis the custom of our sex to take all manner of liberty with one
another, and to talk smuttily, and act waggishly when we are by
ourselves, thoâ€™ we scarce dare listen to a merry tale in manâ€™s company
for fear of being thought impudent. You know the bob-tailâ€™d monster is a
censorious creature, and if we should not be cunning enough to cast a
mist before the eyes of their understanding sometimes there would be no
living among them; and therefore I cannot but highly commend you for
your prudence in covering all your vicious inclinations by an
hypocritical deportment: for how often have we heard men say, thoâ€™ a
woman be a whore, yet they love she should carry herself modestly? that
is as much as to say, they love to be cheated, and you know, <i>Madam</i>, we
can hit<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_252">{252}</a></span> their humours in that particular to a hairs-breadth, and convey
one man away from under our petticoats to make room for another, with as
much dexterity as the <i>German</i> artist does his balls, that the keenest
eye in <i>Christendom</i> shall not discern the juggle, for a woman ought to
be made up of all chinks and crannies, that when a man searches for any
thing he should not find, she may shuffle about her secrets so, that the
devil canâ€™t discover them, or else sheâ€™s fit only to make a sempstress
on, and can never be rightly qualified for intriguing. I have just now
the rememberance of a few female stratagems crept into my head, which
were practised by a pretty lady of my acquaintance, perhaps, <i>Madam</i>, if
they are not stale to you, you may make them of some service hereafter;
therefore in hopes of obliging you, I shall acquaint you with the
particulars.</p>

<p>I happenâ€™d long since in the time of my youth, when powerful nature
prompted me to delight in amorous adventures, to contract a friendship
with a fair lady, who for her wit and beauty, was often times solicited
by the male sex to help make up that beast of pleasure with two backs,
and hating to submit herself to the tyrannical government of a single
person, never wanted a whole parliament of nipples to give her suck,
thoâ€™ she flatterâ€™d one man that kept her, to believe he was sole monarch
of the <i>Low-Countries</i>; but one time he unfortunately happenâ€™d to catch
her, with a new relation, of whom he was a little jealous, believing for
some reasons he had an underhand design of liquoring his boots for him,
to prevent which he imposâ€™d an oath of abjuration upon his mistress, and
made her swear for the future to renounce the sight of him, which to
oblige her keeper, she very readily consented to, but no sooner was his
back turnâ€™d, but she had invented a salve for her conscience, as well as
her concupiscence, and dispatching a letter to her new lover, told him
what had passâ€™d, but withal, encouragâ€™d him to renew his visits at such
opportunities as she informed him were convenient; at the time appointed
her spark came, she received him with a blind compliment, and told him,
she would open any thing but her eyes to oblige him; but those she must
keep shut for her oathâ€™s sake, having sworn never to see him if she
could help it. The gentleman was very well satisfied he had so
conscientious a lady to deal with: love,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_253">{253}</a></span> <i>Madam</i>, says he, is always
blind, and for my part, I shall be content to enjoy the darkest of your
favours; upon which he began vigorously to attack loveâ€™s fortress, which
you know, <i>Madam</i>, has no mere eyes than a beetle; as she told me the
story, he was beat off three times, and at last was forcâ€™d to draw off
his forces, so marchâ€™d off to raise recruits against the next
opportunity. The next day came the governour of the garrison, as he
foolishly thought himself, and made a strict enquiry whether she had any
correspondence with the enemy? lord, Sir, says she, what do you take me
to be? a devil; as I hope to be savâ€™d, I never set eyes of him since you
engagâ€™d me to the contrary: so all things past off as well as if no evil
had been acted.</p>

<p>The next fresh acquaintance she contracted, she would never suffer to
wait upon her at her lodgings, other ways dressâ€™d than in female
apparel; so when a new fit of jealousy put her spark upon purging her
conscience upon oath, as I have a soul to be savâ€™d, says she, no
creature in breeches but yourself has been near me since you had
knowledge of it; therefore why, my dear, should you harbour such ill
thoughts of a woman that loves you as dearly as I do my beads and
crucifix? thus, thoâ€™ she deceivâ€™d him as often as she had opportunity,
yet her discretion kept all things in such admirable decorum, that I
never knew any of the fair sex, except yourself, like her.</p>

<p>If it were not for these witty contrivances, subtle shifts and evasions,
which we are forcâ€™d to use to keep the male sex easy, a pretty or an
ingenious woman, to make one happy must make twenty miserable; or wit
and beauty are never without abundance of admirers; and if such a woman
were to sacrifice all her charms to the miserly temper of one single
lover, the rest must run distracted, and at this rate the whole world in
a short time would become one great <i>Bedlam</i>; besides, since there is
enough to make all happy, if prudently dispensâ€™d, I know no reason why
one man should engross more than he is able to deal with, and other men
want that, which by using there can be no miss of; therefore I commend
you for the liberty you take to oblige your chosen friends, and the
prudence you use to conceal it from the envious number you think
unworthy of your smiles; so with this advice I shall conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_254">{254}</a></span> if you
have twenty gallants that taste your favours in their turns, let no man
know he has a rival-sharer in the happiness, but swear to every one
a-part, none enjoys you but himself; and by this means you will oblige
the whole herd, and make yourself easy in their numerous embraces.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">A. Behn.</span><br />
</p>

<h2><a id="The_Virgins_Answer_to_Mrs_Behn"></a><i>The Virginâ€™s Answer to Mrs.</i> <span class="smcap">Behn</span>.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is no great wonder to me you should prove so witty, since so many
sons of <i>Parnassus</i>, instead of climbing the <i>Heliconian</i> hill, should
stoop so low, as to make your <i>mount of Venus</i> the barren object of
their poetick fancies: I have heard some physicians say, the sweet
fornication draws mightily from the brain; for which reason, it is more
affected with the pleasure than any other part of the body; if so, how
could the spirit of poesy be otherwise than infusâ€™d into you, since you
always gainâ€™d by what the fraternity of the Muses lost in your embraces?
you were the young poets <i>Venus</i>; to you they paid their devotion as a
Goddess, and their first adventure, when they adjournâ€™d from the
university to the town, was to solicite your favours; and this advantage
you enjoyâ€™d above the rest of your sex, that if a young student was but
once infected with a rhiming itch, you by a butterâ€™d bun could make him
an establishâ€™d poet at any time; for the contagion, like that of a worse
distemper, will run a great way, and be often strangely contracted. I
have heard a gentleman say, that when he was bedded with a poetess, or
rivalâ€™d a poet in his mistress, that he has dreamt of nothing but plays,
ballads and lampoons for six months after; and has been forcâ€™d to
cuckold a critick, before he could get curâ€™d of the distemper. From
hence it appears, that a man in his sober senses runs a greater hazard
of his brains in having familiar contract with a daughter of the
<i>Muses</i>, than a drunken man does of his nobler parts, in paving the
common-shore of a town prostitute.</p>

<p>You upbraid me with a great discovery you chancâ€™d to make, by peeping
into the breast of an old friend of mine; if you give yourself but the
trouble of examining an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_255">{255}</a></span> poetâ€™s conscience, who went lately off the
stage, and now takes up his lodgings in your territories, and I donâ€™t
question, but youâ€™ll there find, Mrs. <i>Behn</i> writ as often in black
characters, and stands as thick in some places, as the names of the
generation of <i>Adam</i> in the first of <i>Genesis</i>. But oh! that I had but
one glance into your own accounts; there I am sure, should I find a
compleat register of all the poets of your standing, from the <i>Laureat</i>,
down to the <i>White-Fryars</i> ballad-monger: at this rate, well might you
be esteemâ€™d a female wit, since the least return your versifying
admirers could make you for your favours, was, first to lend you their
assistance, and then oblige you with their applause: besides, how could
you do otherwise than produce some wit to the world, since you were so
often ploughâ€™d and sowâ€™d by the kind husbandmen of <i>Apollo</i>? but give me
leave, <i>Madam</i>, to tell you, after all your amorous intrigues to please
the taglines of the age, and all the fatigue of your brains to oblige a
fickle audience, I never could yet hear that your reputation ever soarâ€™d
above the character of a bawdy poetess; and these were the two knacks
you were chiefly happy in, one was to make libertines laugh, and the
other to make modest women blush; and had you happenâ€™d to have livâ€™d in
a reforming age, under the lash of Mr. <i>C&#8212;&#8212;r</i>, he would have so
firkâ€™d you about the pig-market, that you must have learnâ€™d to have writ
more modestly, or he would have been apt to have said, you certainly
thinnâ€™d your ink with your own water, or you could never have writ so
bawdily.</p>

<p>You seem almost to think it an indispensible difficulty for a woman in
my quality to preserve her reputation, especially if she has done any
thing to deserve the loss of it; I say, a prudent woman may do it with
all the facility imaginable, by keeping up to a few maxims in female
policy, which few woman are strangers to. <i>First</i>, Were I to give myself
liberty (as whether I do or no is no matter to any body) I would always
bestow my favours upon those above me, and those beneath me, and never
be concernâ€™d with any man upon an equal footing; and these are my
reasons: Suppose the vitious eyes of a great man are fixâ€™d upon me, and
my charms should kindle a love-passion in the cockles of his heart; he
writes, chatters, swears and prays, according to custom in such cases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">{256}</a></span>
I still defend the premisses, by a flat verbal denial; but at the same
instant incourage him in my looks, and am always free to oblige him with
my company; till by this sort of usage I make him sensible downright
courtship will never prevail; and that the cittadel he besieges is not
to be surrenderâ€™d without bribing the governess: then he begins to mix
his fine words with fine presents; he gives, I receive, returning a side
glance for a diamond ring, two smiles for a gold watch, a kiss for a
pearle necklace, and at last for a round sum the ultimate of my favours;
of which, in one months time, he is as much tirâ€™d, as a child is of a
<i>Bartholomew</i> knick-knack, and so we seperate again, both fully
satisfied: in this case, I say, a womanâ€™s reputation is pretty safe; for
if he has any brains, he will be afraid to discover I have been his
bedfellow, lest I should tell the world he has been my bubble; for he
canâ€™t help believing, if he had never been my fool, I had never been his
mistress.</p>

<p>In the next place, why I would rather submit to make a friend of an
inferior, than an equal; I think these reasons are sufficient; if I
oblige a man beneath me, he looks upon my condescention to be his
greatest honour; and â€™tis but now and then furnishing his pockets with a
little spending money, and heâ€™ll drudge like a stone-horse to give me a
competent refreshment; not only that, but heâ€™ll lie for me, swear for
me, fight for me, and be always speaking in praise of my virtues upon
every occasion; my mixing his pleasure with profit, makes it so much the
sweeter, and engages him to give my favours a more diligent attendance.
I can govern, comand, expect, and make him more my slave than a woman is
to her keeper; and he takes it to be his only happiness to be so. And
for my part, think there is more satisfaction in having a man that one
likes, in this sort of subjection, than there is in being courtezan to
any gouty peer in <i>Christendom</i>; for I have always had the same ambition
to be mistress over some of the male sex, as some of them have had to
make me their humble servant. These are the reasons why some ladies
submit themselves to the lash of the long whip, and love to be jerkâ€™d by
their coach-man; and why lawyers wives join issue with their husbands
clerks; and shop-keepers help-mates court the benevolence of their
appren<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_257">{257}</a></span>tices: for a womanâ€™s business is seldom done by a man thatâ€™s her
master; and I must frankly confess, were I to be a slave to the best
manâ€™s lust in the kingdom, thoâ€™ kept never so well forâ€™t, if I had not a
man beneath me in the same classis. I should think my life but in a
miserable confinement; for there is no other pleasure in money got over
the devilâ€™s back, but in spending it under his belly; besides, if a
womanâ€™s reputation be safe in any manâ€™s power, it must certainly be
secure in the custody of an inferior so obligâ€™d; for interest is the
best padlock in the world to confine a tongue to silence: but if you
make an equal your familiar, and no interest binding on either side,
upon every little disgust it shall be, confound you for a wh&#8212;re, what
made you disappoint me? d&#8212;mn you for a jilt, what spark were you
engagâ€™d with? and this sort of usage, in a little time, a woman must
expect to be treated with; and ten to one, but at last exposâ€™d; and this
is all the gratitude the poor loving fool shall meet with for her
kindness.</p>

<p>Pray, <i>Madam</i>, thoâ€™ I have been so free with you, as to deliver you my
sentiments, donâ€™t you take me to be a person that ever put them into
practice; I only tell you, according to my present judgment, what I
believe I should do, was I under the same predicament with many ladies,
whom I see daily in the boxes; but I thank my stars, I had always more
modesty than to be lewd; and more generosity, than to be mercenary; and
have hitherto took care to preserve a virtuous reputation,
notwithstanding I know what I know; therefore I defy your conscience
peeping; besides, that was in another world; and when all comes to all,
I believe â€™tis only a piece of your own romantick wit, and as such I
take it. <i>So farewel.</i></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is no little grief to me on this side the grave, to hear what a low
ebb the good old trade of basket-making is reducâ€™d to in the age you
live in; for I hear it is as much as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_258">{258}</a></span> a woman of tolerable beauty, and
reasonable share of experience can well do, to keep clean smocks to her
back, and pay her surgeon; when in my time, praised be the l&#8212;rd for it,
I kept my family as neat and sweet, poor girls, as any aldermanâ€™s
daughters in the city of <i>London</i>. I donâ€™t know what scandal our
profession may be dwindled into since my departure from the upper world;
but I am sure throâ€™ the course of my life, I was lookâ€™d upon by the
whole city to be as honest an old gentlewoman, as ever hazarded her soul
for the service of her country; and always took care to deal in as good
commodities, as any shopkeeper in <i>London</i> could desire to have the
handling of, true, wholesom country-ware; whole waggon-loads have I had
come up at a time, have dressâ€™d them at my own expence, made them fit
for manâ€™s use, and put them into a saleable condition. The clergy, I am
sure, were much beholden to me, for many a poor parsonâ€™s daughter have I
taken care on, bought her shifts to her back, put a trade into her
belly, taught her a pleasant livelihood, that she might support herself
like a woman, without being beholden to any body; who otherwise must
have turnâ€™d drudge, waited upon some proud minx or other, or else have
depended upon relations; yet these unmannerly priests had the sinful
ingratitude before I dyâ€™d, to refuse praying for me in their churches;
thoâ€™ I dealt by all people with a conscience, and was so well beloved in
the parish I livâ€™d in, that the churchwardens themselves became my daily
customers.</p>

<p>My home was always a sanctuary for distressed ladies; I never refusâ€™d
meat, drink, washing, lodging, and cloaths, to any that had the least
spark of wit, youth, beauty, or gentility, to recommend them to my
charity; ladies women, chambermaids, cookmaids of any sort, when out of
service, were at all times welcome to my table, â€™till they could better
provide for themselves; and I am sure, thoâ€™ I say it that should not, I
kept as hospitable a house for all comers and goers, as any woman in
<i>England</i>; for the best of flesh was never wanting to delight the
appetites of both sexes; the toppingest shopkeepers in the city usâ€™d now
and then to visit me for a good supper; and I never failâ€™d of having a
tid-bit ready for them; dainties that were hot and hot, never over-done,
but always with the gravy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_259">{259}</a></span> them, which pleasâ€™d them so wonderfully,
that they usâ€™d to cry their own victuals at home was meer carrion to it;
nay, their very wives, sometimes, contrary to their own husbands
knowledge, have trippâ€™d in, in an evening, complainâ€™d they have been as
hungry as hawks, and desired me to provide a morsel for them that might
satisfy their bellies; for you must know, both sexes were wonderful
lovers of my cookery, and would feed very heartily upon such nice
dainties that I tossâ€™d up for them, when no other sort of flesh would by
any means go down with them. Many hopeful babes have been beholden to my
mansion-house for their generation; who thoâ€™ they were never wise enough
to know their own father, yet some of them, for ought I know, may at
this day be aldermen; for I have had as good merchants ladies, as ever
livâ€™d in <i>Mincing-lane</i>, apply themselves to my fertile habitation for
change of diet; and have come twice or thrice a week to refresh nature
with my standing dishes; for I always kept an open house to feast
lovers; and, <i>Jove</i> be thanked, never wanted variety to gratify the
appetites of mankind. Thirty pair of haunches, both bucks and does, have
been wagging their scuts at one another within the compass of one
evening; and many noblemen, notwithstanding they had deer of their own,
usâ€™d to come to my park for a bit of choice venison, for I never wanted
what was fat and good, thoâ€™ within my pale it was all the year
rutting-time.</p>

<p>It is well known, I kept as good orders in my house as ever was observed
in a nunnery; I had a church-bible always lay open upon my hall-table,
and had every room in my house furnishâ€™d with the <i>Practice of Piety</i>,
and other good books for the edification of my family; that for every
minute they sinnâ€™d, they might repent an hour at their leisure
intervals. I kept a chaplain in my house, and had prayers read twice a
day, as constantly as the sun rises in a morning, and sets in an
evening; and thoâ€™ I say it, I had a parcel of as honest religious girls
about me, as ever pious matron had under her tuition at a <i>Hackney</i>
boarding-school; nor would they ever dare to humble the proud flesh of a
sinner without my leave or approbation; and, like good christians, as
often as they had sinnâ€™d, came to auricular confession. I always did
every thing in the fear of the lord, and was, I thank my Creator, so
happy in my memory, that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">{260}</a></span> had as many texts of scripture at command,
as a presbyterian parson. For my zeal to religion, and the services I
daily did to the publick community, I bless my stars, I never wanted a
city magistrate to stand my friend in the times of persecution, or any
other adversity; but could have half the court of aldermen appear on my
behalf at an hourâ€™s warning. I kept a painter in my house perpetually
employâ€™d upon fresh faces, and had a good as collection of pictures, to
the life, as ever were to be seen in <i>Lilly</i>â€™s showing-room; beauties of
all complexions, from the cole-black cling-fast, to the golden-lockâ€™d
insatiate, from the sleepyeâ€™d slug, to the brisk-eyâ€™d wanton; from the
reservâ€™d hypocrite, to the lewâ€™d fricatrix; so that every man might
choose by the shadow, what kind of beauteous substance would give his
fancy the greatest titillation. Every room in my house was adornâ€™d with
the picture of some grave bishop, that my customers might see what a
great veneration I had for the clergy; all my lodgings were as well
furnishâ€™d, as the splendid apartments of a princeâ€™s palace; that every
citizen, whose wife had been kissâ€™d at court, might fancy in revenge, by
the richness of his bed, he was making a cuckold of a nobleman. I never
was without <i>Viper-wine</i> for a fumbler, to give a spur to old age and
assist impotency. I also had right <i>French Claret</i>, and the flower of
<i>Canary</i>, to wash away the dregs of the last <i>Sunday</i>â€™s sermon, that the
bugbears of conscience might not fright a good churchman from the
pleasures of fornication. I had orders in every room, against cathedral
exercise, or beastical back-slidings, and made it ten shillings
forfeiture for any that were caught in such actions; because I would not
be bilkâ€™d of my bed-money. These were the measures I took in my
occupation to procure an honest livelihood; and Heaven be praisâ€™d, I
thrivâ€™d as well in my profession, as if my calling had been licensable.
How times are alterâ€™d since, I know not, but I hear, to my great sorrow,
that bawding, of late years, which usâ€™d to be a trade of itself, is now
grown scandalous, and very much declinâ€™d by reason that midwives, like a
parcel of incroaching husseys, have engrossâ€™d the whole business to
themselves, to the starving of you experiencâ€™d old ladies, who have
spent their days, and worn out their beauty in the service of the
publick; and ought in all equity to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_261">{261}</a></span> the only persons, thought
qualifiâ€™d for so judicious an undertaking, to support them in their old
age, when father time has strippâ€™d them of their charms, and their noble
faculties fail them; besides, I hear noblemen employ their own valets,
ladies their own waiting women, citizens wives one another, and all to
save charges, to the ruin of our poor sister-hood.</p>

<p>Alack a-day! what a pernicious age do you live in? that traders should
trust one another to buy their commodities, and all to save the expence
of brokerage. I fear, there are some instruments among yourselves, that
have been the main occasion of your being thus neglected. I shall
further proceed, to give you a little advice, which, if but duly
observâ€™d, may, I hope, in a little time, recover the antient state of
bawdery into a flourishing condition, and make it once more as reputable
a calling, as it was when clergymens widows, and decayâ€™d ladies at
court, did not disdain to follow it.</p>

<p>Never neglect publick prayers twice a day, hear two sermons every
<i>Sunday</i>, receive the sacrament once a month, but let this be done at a
church where you are unknown; and be sure read the scriptures often, and
be sure fortify your tongue with abundance of godly sayings, let them
drop from you in strange company, as thick as ripe fruit from the tree
in a high wind; and whenever you have a design upon the daughter, be
sure of the motherâ€™s faith, and ply her closely with religion, and she
will trust her beloved abroad with you in hopes she may edify; for you
must consider, there is no being a perfect bawd without being a true
hypocrite.</p>

<p>Always have a lodging separate from your house, in a place of credit;
where, upon an occasion, you may entertain the parents without being
suspected, and corrupt the minds of their children before they know your
employment: you must first pour the poison in at their ears, infect
their thoughts, and when their fancies begin to itch, they will have
their tails rubbâ€™d in spite of the devil.</p>

<p>Whenever you have a maiden-head, be sure make a penny of the first
fruits, and at the second-hand let the next justice of peace have the
residue on free cost, thoâ€™ you must give her her lesson, and present her
as a pure virgin;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_262">{262}</a></span> by this sort of bribery, you may win all the
magistrates in <i>Middlesex</i>; make <i>Hicksâ€™s-hall</i> your sanctuary, and gain
an useful ascendency over the whole bench of justices.</p>

<p>Never admit common faces into your domestick seraglio, â€™tis a scandal to
your family, a dishonour to your function, and will certainly spoil your
trade; but ply close at inns upon the coming in of waggons, and
gee-ho-coaches, and there you may hire fresh country wenches, sound,
plump, and juicy, and truly qualified for your business.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, never trust any of your tits into an inn of court, or
inn of chancery, for if you do they will certainly harass her about from
chamber to chamber, till they have rid her off her legs; elevate her by
degrees, from the ground-floor to their garrets, and make her drudge
like a landress, throâ€™ a whole stair-case; and after a good weeks work,
send her home with foul linnen, torn heed-geer, rumbled scarf, apparel
spewâ€™d upon, without fan, with but one glove, no money, and perhaps a
hot tail into the bargain.</p>

<p>This advice for the present, if put in practice, I hope will prove of
use to you; I must tell you, there is nothing to be done in the world
you live in, without cunning; religion itself, without policy, is too
simple to be safe; therefore, if you do but take care for the future and
deal by the world, as a woman of your station ought to do, and play your
cards like a gamestress, I donâ€™t at all question, but the mystery of
bawding, by your good management, may be raisâ€™d again, in spite of
reformation, to its pristine eminency; which are the hearty wishes of,</p>

<p><i>Loving Sister</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><i><span class="letra">Y</span>OUR compassionate letter, has so won my affections to your pious
memory, that it shall be always my endea<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_263">{263}</a></span>vour to pursue your kind
instructions, and to make myself the happy imitatrix of your glorious
example, having often, with great satisfaction, heard of your fame;
which as long as there is a young libertine, or an honest old
whoremaster living upon earth, can never be obliterated. Were I to give
you an account of the severe usage, and many persecutions I have been
under of late days, since the mercenary reformation of ill-manners has
been put on foot, it would soften the most obdurate wretches within your
infernal precincts, and make them squeeze me out a tear of pity, thoâ€™
your unextinguishable fire had so dryâ€™d their souls, that their
immortalities were crusted into perfect cinder.</i></p>

<p><i>Of all the unmerciful impositions that ever were laid upon bumb-labour,
none ever so highly afflicted, or so insupportably oppress us, the
retailers of copulation, as this intolerable society, who have bribâ€™d
those who were our pimps to forsake our interest; and have made those
scoundrels who were our meanest servants, our implacable masters; who
come in clusters like cowardly bailiffs to arrest a bully; distrain our
commodities for want of money to pacify their greedy avarice; fright
away our customers, and make us pawn our cloaths to redeem little more
than our nakedness from a cat of nine-tails, and the filthy confines of
a stinking prison: At least five hundred of these reformed vultures are
daily plundering our pockets, and ransacking our houses, leaving me
sometimes not one pair of tractable buttocks in my vaulting-school to
provide for my family, or earn me so much as a pudding for my next</i>
Sundayâ€™s <i>dinner: nay, sometimes I have been forcâ€™d to wag my own hand
to get a penny for want of a journey-woman in my house to dispatch
business. To shun their jury, I once got sanctuary in the</i>
Rolls-<i>liberty, where I thought myself as safe as a fox in a badgers
hole, and had bid defiance to the rogues even to this day, for only
sacrificing now and then an elemosynary maiden-head to the fumbling of
old impotency; but some ill-naturâ€™d observators beginning to reflect,
occasionâ€™d my good friend to look a little a-skew upon me, when he found
his gravity and reputation began to be smearâ€™d a little; so that I was
soon tossâ€™d out by his untimely fear, whose lust before had kindly given
me protection: and now again, as true as I am a sinner, the rogues
plunderâ€™d me<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">{264}</a></span> of at least eight pence out of every shilling for
forbearance-money, and I believe will grow so unreasonable in a little
time, that they will not be content with less gain than an apothecary.
The officers of the parish, where-ever I livâ€™d, had the scouring of
their old rusty hangers for a word speaking, without so much as
gratifying the wench for making the bed, or being ever at the expence of
presenting one of my poor girls with a paper-fan, or a pair of taffeta
shoestrings. One honest churchwarden, I must confess, when I livâ€™d in
St.</i> Andrew<i>â€™s parish, after I had servâ€™d him and his son with the
choicest goods in my warehouse for above two years together, till they
had got a wife between them, had the gratitude, like an honest man, to
present me with a looking-glass; which I took so kindly at his hands,
that I declare it, should he come to my house to morrow, I would oblige
him with as good a commodity in my way, as a worthy old fornicator or
adulterer would desire to lay his hand upon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thus plaguing and pillaging of all our known houses of delight, has
been a great discouragement to young ladies from tendring their service
at such places, or rendevouzing in numbers upon the lawful occasions
that concern their livelihood, for fear of trouble or molestation, and
make them rather choose to deel singly, as interlopers, than incorporate
themselves with the company of town-traders, for fear of being scratchâ€™d
out of their burrows by those reforming ferrets, who make worse havock
with the poor sculking creatures, than so many weasles or pole-cats
would do with coneys in a warren; they sleep in fear, walk in dread,
converse in danger, do their business, poor wretches, insteed of
pleasure, with an aking heart. Oh, sister! what a miserable age is this
we live in after you, that one part of mankind cannot obey the great law
of nature, but the other part shall make a law to punish them for doing
it! Which sport, if totally neglected, would soon make lions, and tygers
princes of the earth, and turn the world into a solitary wilderness.</i></p>

<p><i>I cannot but reflect, with great concern, upon the unreasonableness of
some men in authority, who loving the old trade of basket-making so well
themselves, are so inveterate against the same practice in others, that
I cannot but believe, they think the sweet sin of copulation ought to be
enjoyâ€™d by none under the dignity of a justice of peace, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_265">{265}</a></span> at least
the authority of a high constable: nay, and are so inveterate when they
grow old, against other creatures who they know use it, that a grave
city magistrate, one of the reformed-society, seeing a young game cock
of his own, refresh his featherâ€™d mistress three times in about half an
hour, he grew so wonderful angry with the lascivious chaunticleer, that
he orderâ€™d him forthwith to be deprivâ€™d of his progenitors, for
committing so foul an act with such indecent immoderation; looking upon
the intemperance to be a shameful example, sufficient to stir up
inordinate desires in mankind, and to put the female part of his own
family upon unreasonable expectancies; but the good lady of the house
enquired into the reason, why the noble little creature was so severely
dealt by, and being informâ€™d by her chamber-maid, she compassionately
declarâ€™d, that she would rather have given five pound than so barbarous
an action had been done in her family, for that the bird committed no
offence, and therefore deservâ€™d no punishment. Observe but in this
particular the cruelty of sordid man, and the tenderness of the female
sex! and how can those poor girls, who have nothing to depend on but the
drudgery of flipflap, expect any other than severe usage from so morose
a creature? For certain, whilst publick magistrates are in their
authority so stiff, and private women in their own houses so pliable,
the ladies of the town must starve, and be firkâ€™d about from one</i>
Bridewell <i>to another; for the favours of a kind mistress, which were
once thought the most valuable blessings beneath the clouds, are now
become, throâ€™ the universal corruption of the female sex, such
unregarded drugs, that the scene is quite reversâ€™d, and as women usâ€™d to
take money formerly as but just recompence for their soft embraces, they
are forcâ€™d to give money now, or else they will have a hard matter to
procure a gallant that is worth whistling after. How therefore at this
rate, are the poor whores like to be fed, when the rich ones buy up all
for their cats, and the middling whores in private lie and pick up the
crumbs? For what wonâ€™t down with the quality, are snappâ€™d up by
citizens-wives, sempstresses and head-dressers; insomuch, that I have
several pretty nymphs under my own jurisdiction, that some weeks I may
modestly say, donâ€™t earn money enough to pay their three-penny
admittances into</i> Pancras-<i>wells, but are often-times forcâ€™d to tick
half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_266">{266}</a></span> sice a piece for their watering; and were it not for the credit
I always preserve in those places, the poor wenches might be dashâ€™d out
of countenance by being refusâ€™d entrance; but money or no money, if they
are my puppets, and name but who they belong to, they are as kindly
receivâ€™d as so many butchers at the</i> Bear-Garden; <i>for without them
there would be no sport. You may from thence observe what an honest
reputation I maintain abroad for a lady of my calling, that the word of
the homeliest courtezan protected under my roof, will pass for
three-pence any where that sheâ€™s known, without the least exception,
when many a poor house-keeper has not credit for a two-penny loaf.</i></p>

<p><i>We have nothing to hope for, but that the national senate, throâ€™ their
wonted wisdom, will find out, without shamming onâ€™t, some real expedient
to restrain the looseness of the age, and promote the practice of
morality and strict observance of religion; for throâ€™ all the experience
I have had in the mystery of intriguing, I have ever found the ladyâ€™s
students in the school of</i> Venus, <i>attended with the most prosperity
when the people are most pious; whether it is that a good conscience
teaches gentlemen to be more grateful to their mistresses, or that as
the priests grow fat, the petticoat flourishes, I will leave you to
determine: so thanking you for the kind advice you gave me in your
letter, which shall always be esteemâ€™d a guide to my future practice</i>,</p>

<p><i>By Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Tho. Brown</span>.</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Was forcâ€™d to break off my last abruptly, by reason of the vast crowds
of people, which pressâ€™d upon me then for advice, so that I could not
present you with a full catalogue of my cures, which you will find at
the conclusion of this, or acquaint you with what transactions of moment
have lately happenâ€™d in our gloomy regions. But having by miracle a
vacant hour or two at present upon my hands, which, by the by, is a
blessing I am seldom troubled with, I was resolvâ€™d not to neglect so
fair a opportunity of paying my respects to you, and therefore without
any more preface or formality, will continue the thread of my narration.</p>

<p>I had no sooner publishâ€™d my bill and catalogue of cures, but my house
has been crouded ever since with prodigious shoals of patients, that I
can hardly afford myself an hour to pass with my friends: they flock
from all corners of this gigantic city, so that sometimes not only my
court-yard<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_268">{268}</a></span> which is very large and spacious, but even my chamber, my
anti-chamber, and if youâ€™ll allow me, gentlemen, to coin a new word, my
pro-anti-chamber, or my hall, is full of them: I will only tell you the
names of a few customers of quality that resorted to me for advice
yesterday morning: to give you an idea of my business, and how
considerable â€™tis like to prove.</p>

<p>About a month after my setting up, who should rap at my door, but the
famous <i>Semiramis</i>? I remembered her royal phiz perfectly well, ever
since my friend <i>Nokes</i> carried me to her coffee-house, and treated me
there with a glass of <i>Geneva</i>; however, for certain reasons of state I
did not think it proper to let her <i>Babylonian</i> majesty know, that I was
acquainted either with her name or quality; come good woman, said I to
her, what is your business? <i>Oh!</i> replies she, <i>you see the most
unfortunate, unhappy creature in the world</i>. Why what calamity has
befallen you? <i>Only</i>, says she, <i>too big for words to express</i>; with
that she wrung her hands, stampâ€™d upon the floor, cursing the
left-handed planet she was born under, and pouring down such a deluge of
tears, that one would have thought it had been the second edition of the
<i>Ephesian</i> matron, lamenting the loss of one spouse in order to wheedle
on a second. When her grief had pretty well exhausted itself at the
sluices of her eyes, she thus continuâ€™d her tragical <i>historietto</i>.
<i>Were I minded, doctor, to trouble you with my genealogy, I could
perhaps, make it easily appear, that few people are descended of better
parents than myself, but let that pass; the scene is alterâ€™d with me at
present, and rather than take up with ill courses, or to be troublesom
to my relations, I am content to keep a coffee-house. Now as I was
sitting in my bar this morning, and footing a pair of stockings for</i>
Alexander <i>the</i> great, <i>in came two rascally grenadiers, and askâ€™d for
some juniper; but alas! while I was gone down into the cellar to fetch
it, these lubberly rogues plunderâ€™d me of a silver spoon and
nutmeg-grater, and made their escape</i>. Come mistress, says I, this loss
is not so great but a little diligence may retrieve it. <i>Oh never</i>, says
she again, <i>unless you help me by your art, I am utterly undone to all
intents and purposes</i>. Finding her so much mortifyâ€™d for the loss of her
two utensils, I resolvâ€™d to exert the fortune-teller to her, and banter
her in the laudable terms of astro<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_269">{269}</a></span>logy; so putting on a very composâ€™d
countenance, I seemâ€™d very seriously to consult a celestial globe that
stood before me; then enquiring the precise time when this horrid theft
was committed, I drew several odd figures and strokes upon a piece of
paper, and at last the oracle thus openâ€™d: <i>Mistress, it appears I find
by the</i> Heliocentric <i>position of the planets, that</i> Jupiter, <i>you
understand me, is become stationary to retrogradation in</i> Cancer, <i>and
consequently, you observe me, mistress, equivocal to him; but how and
why in</i> Trine <i>to</i> Mercury <i>in</i> Scorpio, <i>both posited in watry signs,
and at the same time</i> Mars <i>being ascendant of the second house, as you
may perceive, â€™tis as plain that the culminating aspect of</i> Saturn<i>â€™s</i>
Satellites, <i>do ye mind me, centres full in the foresaid configuration.
So then mistress, the hoary question thus resolves itself</i>, viz. <i>That
your goods were carryâ€™d away</i> South-East <i>by</i> East <i>of your house, under
the sign of a four-footed creature, and if youâ€™ll leave open your
parlour windows a-nights, I dare pawn my life and honour, that both your
silver spoon and nutmeg-grater will be flung into the house one of the
nights</i>. <i>Semiramis</i> was wonderfully pleasâ€™d to hear such news, dropt me
a fee, and went about her business.</p>

<p>She was hardly gone, but in came queen <i>Dido</i>, who the last time I saw
her callâ€™d <i>Virgil</i> so many rogues and rascals in my hearing, for
raising such a malicious story of her and and the pious <i>Ã†neas</i>; it was
a long time before I could get her to tell me what errand she came
about: at last, after abundance of blushing, and covering half her face
with her hood, <i>Seignior</i> Hanesio, says she, <i>I doubt not but a person
of your experience has observâ€™d in his time but too many instances of
female infirmity. To be plain with you, I am one, and thoâ€™ I made as
great a splutter about my virtue as the soundest of my sex, yet I was a
damnâ€™d recreant all that while. In short, I find by several indications
which I have not namâ€™d to you, doctor, that I am with child,&#8212;and being
very tender of my reputation,&#8212;which, doctor, is all we poor women have
to depend upon,&#8212;&#8212; and loth to have my good name exposâ€™d in ballads and
lampoons.&#8212;&#8212; I beg the favour of you, dear doctor,&#8212;&#8212; and you shall
find I will gratify you nobly for your pains, to help me to something
that shall make me,&#8212;&#8212; but you know my meaning, doctor.&#8212;&#8212; To miscarry
is it not, Madam? You are in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_270">{270}</a></span> right onâ€™t, dear Sir, replyâ€™d she. Why
then, Madam, I must tell you, are come to the wrong house; for whether
you know it or no, I carry a tender conscience about me, mind me what I
say, I carry a tender conscience about me, and would not be guilty of
such a wicked thing as you mention for the world. But there is an</i>
Italian <i>son of a whore at the corner of the street, that will poison
you and the child in your belly, and half the women in the city for half
a crown. You may make your application to him, if you think fit, but for
my part, Madam, Iâ€™ll be perjurâ€™d for no body; for as I told you before,
my conscience is tender</i>: Upon this our famous <i>coquette</i> immediately
withdrew in a great deal of confusion, and cursâ€™d me plentifully in her
gizzard, I donâ€™t question.</p>

<p>My next visitant was <i>Lucretia</i>, who brought some of her water in an
<i>urinal</i>, and desirâ€™d me to give her my judgment onâ€™t. Finding her
ladyship look a little blueish, and so forth, under the eyes; what was
more, having been privately informâ€™d of the correspondence she kept with
<i>Ã†sop</i> the <i>fabulist</i>; <i>Madam</i>, says I bluntly to her, <i>the party to
whom this urine belongs, is under none of the most healthful
circumstances, but troubled with certain prickings and pains. Iâ€™ll
swear, doctor</i>, says she, <i>you are a man of skill, for to my certain
knowledge the party is troubled with those concerns you were talking of.
You need not forestal me, Madam</i>, says I to her, <i>but especially when
she makes water; I knew it as soon as ever I cast my eyes upon the
urinal: and pray, Sir, what may be the occasion of it? for the party is
at a horrid loss, what is the matter with her. Why, Madam</i>, says I, <i>the
matter is plain enough, the party has been committing acts of privity
with somebody, and has disobligâ€™d loveâ€™s mansion by it: or to express
myself in the familiar language of a modern versificator and quack</i>;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<span class="i0"><i>Has been dabbling in private, and had the mishap,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In seeking for pleasure to meet with a clap.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><i>How doctor, says she, have you the impudence to say the party is
clapt?</i> verily, Madam, and yet I am no more impudent than some of my
neighbours. <i>Why you saucy fellow you</i>, continues she, <i>Iâ€™d have you to
know that I am the party to whome the urine belongs, and my name is</i>
Lucretia, <i>that celebrated matron in</i> Roman <i>history, who scorn<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_271">{271}</a></span>ing to
out-live her honour, perferrâ€™d a voluntary death to an ignominious life.
Yes, Madam</i>, says I, <i>I know your history well enough, and whatever
opinion I may have of your chastity, I have yet a greater of your
discretion; for, between friends be it said, Madam, before you left the
insignificant world, you were resolvâ€™d to taste the sweetness of young</i>
Tarquin<i>â€™s person; and finding what a vast difference there was between
vigorous love and phlegmatick duty, you thought it not worth your while
to be troubled any longer with the dull embraces of an impotent husband.
Oh most abominable scandal</i>, cries our matron, <i>but Heaven be praisâ€™d</i>
Livy <i>tells another story of my chastity; and to let thee see how
scrupulous and careful I am to preserve my reputation spotless, know, I
keep company with none but moralists and philosophers. Lord, Madam</i>,
says I, <i>your intrigues are no mysteries to me: I am no stranger to that
laudable commerce you keep with that crook-backâ€™d moralist and
fable-monger of</i> Phrygia, <i>they call him my lord; Ã†sop</i> (at which
unwelcome words she lookâ€™d paler than I have the charity to believe she
did when the impetuous <i>Tarquin</i> leapt into bed to her) <i>and as for
those sage recommenders of virtue, the philosophers, take my word for
it, a clap may be got as soon among them, as any other sort of men
whatsoever. Since my coming into these parts, Madam, I am able to give
you a true account of the present state of most of these</i> Philosophersâ€™
<i>bodies</i>. Thales, <i>who held that</i> Water <i>was the beginning of all
things, is now satisfyâ€™d that</i> Fire <i>is the conclusion of love</i>.
Pythagoras <i>that run throâ€™ so many changes in the other world, has
undergone a greater transmutation here in a sweating tub. The divine</i>
Plato, <i>and his disciple</i> Aristotle, <i>are at this present writing very
lovingly salivating in my garret</i>. Socrates <i>had his shin-bones scrapâ€™d
tâ€™other morning by my toad-eater Dr.</i> Connor, <i>by the same token the</i>
Hibernian <i>thrashâ€™d him for swearing so inordinately at his</i> dÃ¦mon <i>that
led him into this mischance</i>. Aristotle <i>told me last night, that
nothing in philosophy troubled him so much as pissing of needles</i>.
Diogenes <i>has a phiz so merrily collyflowerâ€™d, that he protests against
planting of men, since these are the effects of it; and the virtuous</i>
Seneca <i>has lost all his</i> Roman <i>patience with his nose. But alas, these
solemn splaymouthâ€™d gentlemen, Madam</i>, says I, <i>only do it to improve in
natural philosophy, with no wicked intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_272">{272}</a></span> I can assure you, no
carnal titillation to urge them on, or the like. Well, says she, since
â€™tis in vain to play the hypocrite any longer, I own myself a downright
frail woman, therefore resolve me what is best to be done for my
recovery? Look you, Madam</i>, says I, <i>you must take physick, and live
sober for a fortnight or so, and Iâ€™ll engage to make you as primitively
sound as when you first came squaling into the world. Hereâ€™s a dose of
pills the devil of any</i> Mercury<i>â€™s in them; take four of them every
morning, and to make them operate the better, drink me a quart of
honest</i> Phlegethon <i>a little warmâ€™d over the fire, and mix some grated
nutmeg with it to correct the crudity</i>. She promisâ€™d to observe my
directions, presented me with half a score broad pieces, and as she was
going out of the room, <i>Worthy doctor</i>, says she, <i>I conjure you to have
a care of my dear dear reputation: And</i>, Madam, answers I, <i>pray have
you likewise a care of your dear dear brandy bottle, and your beloved
Dr.</i> Steven<i>â€™s water with the gold in it</i>; and so we parted.</p>

<p>I was thinking with myself, surely it rains nothing but female visitants
this morning, when a brace of two handed strapping jades bolted into my
closet, and upon a due examination of their faces, I found one of them
to be <i>Thalestris</i> the <i>Amazonian</i>, who, as I hinted to you in my last,
is become an haberdasheress of small wares; and the other that termagant
motly composition of half man half woman, <i>Christiana</i> the late queen of
<i>Sweden</i>. So my two chopping <i>Bona Robaâ€™s</i>, says I to â€™em and what
business has brought you hither? <i>Why you must know, cries</i> Thalestris,
<i>that both of us are furiously in love and want a little of your
assistance</i>.</p>

<p>The ladies may be always sure of commanding that, answers I, but pray
explain yourselves more particularly. <i>For my part, says</i> Thalestris,
<i>having formerly been happy in the embraces of</i> Alexander <i>the great, I
could never fancy anything but a soldier ever since. Why our military
men</i>, says I, <i>have been always famous for attacking and carrying all
places before them, but pray tell me the happy personâ€™s name, whom you
have singled from the rest of his sex to honour with your affection?
With the malicious world</i>, continues she, <i>he passes for a bully, but I
call him my lovely charming Capt.</i> Dawson; <i>â€™tis true, I am not
altogether disagreeable to this cruel insensible; he likes the majesty
of my person,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_273">{273}</a></span> my humour and wit well enough; but tâ€™other morning he
told me, over a porringer of burnt brandy, when people are apt to
unbosom themselves, that he had an unconquerable aversion to red hair,
and so I am come to see whether you have any relief for this misfortune,
as you promise in your bills. This is no business of mine</i>, says I to
her, <i>but my wifeâ€™s whoâ€™ll soon redress your grievances, and furnish you
with a leaden comb and my</i> Anti-ErythrÃ¦an <i>unguent, which after two or
three applications will make you as fair or as brown as you desire</i>. And
having said so, addressâ€™d myself to her companion, and enquirâ€™d of her
what she came for? <i>I am up to the ears in love, says</i> Christiana, <i>with
a jolly smock-facâ€™d duchessâ€™s chaplain lately arrivâ€™d in these parts; I
have already signifyâ€™d my passion to him, both after the antient and
modern way, persecuted him with</i> Latin <i>and</i> French billet-deux, <i>for
which I was always famous: but this stubborn</i> Theologue <i>tells me my
face is too masculine for him, and particularly quarrels with the
irregularity of my forehead and eyebrows. Those will easily be
recftifyâ€™d by my wife</i>, says I: <i>and now, Madam, will you give me leave
to ask you a civil question or two?</i> a hundred, my dear <i>seignior</i>,
answers she very obligingly. <i>To be short then</i>, says I, <i>a certain</i>
French <i>author, who has writ the memoirs of your life, has been pleasâ€™d
positively to assert, that your majesty went throâ€™ at least one half of
the college of cardinals, and that two or three popes were suspected of
being familiar with you. I wanted</i>, answers she, <i>no sort of consolation
from those noble personages, while I livâ€™d at</i> Rome; <i>and to convince
you how well I am satisfied in their abilities, by my good will, I would
have to do with none but ecclesiasticks; for besides that they eat and
drink plentifully, and by consequence want no vigour, they possess
another no less commendable quality, and that is taciturnity. I applaud
your judgment</i>, replies I, <i>for your churchmen are true feeders and
thundering performers. No body knows that better than myself</i>, says
Christiana, <i>and take my word for it, one robust well-chined priest is
worth a hundred of your lean half starvâ€™d captains. Iâ€™ll never hear the
soldiery blasphemâ€™d, says</i> Thalestris, <i>in a mighty passion, I tell
thee, thou insignificant north country trollop, thou foolish affected
grammarian-ridden she-pedant, that one soldier is better than a thousand
of your stiff-rumpâ€™d parsons</i>; and immediately saluted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_274">{274}</a></span> her with a
discourteous reprimand a cross the mazzard. The blood of <i>Gustavus
Adolphus</i> began to be rousâ€™d in <i>Christiana</i>, and my glasses, globes,
and crocodile and all, were infallibly going to rack between these two
furious heroines, when my wife luckily stept in to put an end to the
fray. In short the matter was amicable made up, and so they followâ€™d my
spouse into her closet, where Iâ€™ll leave them.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>gentlemen</i>, you may perceive what sort of customers resort to me,
I could tell you a hundred more stories to the same purpose, but why
should I pretend to entertain persons of your worth with so mean and
unworthy a subject as my self? therefore to diversify the scene, I will
endeavour to divert you with some occurences of a more publick
importance, which have happenâ€™d in our <i>Acherontic</i> dominions since I
writ to you last.</p>

<p>But before I proceed any farther I am to inform you, that we have a
spacious noble room in the middle of <i>Brandinopolis</i>, where the
virtuosos of former ages as well as of the present, use to resort and
entertain one another with learned or facetious conversation, according
as it happens. Of late we have had the same controversy debated among
us, which so long employâ€™d monsieur <i>Perault</i> and the famous wits of
<i>France</i>, I mean, whether the antients are preferable to the moderns in
the learned arts and sciences. The question had been discussâ€™d one
afternoon with a great deal of heat on both sides, when an honest merry
gentleman and a new comer among us, whose name I have unluckily forgot,
interposâ€™d in the dispute, and expressâ€™d himself to this effect.
Gentlemen, says he, I think you may eâ€™en drop this controversy, for I
can make it appear, that little <i>England</i> alone affords a set of men at
present, that much out-do any of the antients in whatever they pretend
to. Thereâ€™s honest Mr. <i>Edmund Whiteaker</i>, late of the admiralty office,
that in the mystery of making up accounts out-does <i>Archimedes</i>; and my
lord <i>Puzzlechalk</i>, who told his masterâ€™s money over a gridiron,
understands numbers better than <i>Archytas</i> or <i>Euclid</i>. Mr. <i>Burgess</i> of
<i>Covent-Garden</i>, and indeed most of the <i>dissenting parsons</i>, go
infinitely beyond <i>Tully</i> and <i>Demosthenes</i> in point of eloquence; for
those old fashionâ€™d orators could only raise joy and sadness
successively, whereas the latter so manage<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_275">{275}</a></span> matters, that they can make
their congregations laugh and weep both at once. The antients were
forcâ€™d to drudge and take pains to make themselves masters of any tongue
before they pretended to write in it; but hereâ€™s <i>your old friend Dr.</i>
Case <i>by Ludgate</i>, writ a system of anatomy in <i>Latin</i>, and does not
understand a syllable of the language. As for musick you may talk till
your heart akes of your <i>Amphions</i> and your <i>Orpheus</i>â€™s, that drew trees
and stones after them by the irresistible force of their harmony; this
is so far from being a miracle among us, that the vilest thrummers in
<i>England</i> and <i>Wales</i> do it every wake and fair they go to: then as for
the various perturbations of mind causâ€™d by the antient musick, we saw
something more wonderful happen upon our own theatre since the late
revolution, than antiquity can boast of; for when <i>Harry Purcel</i>â€™s
famous winter song at the <i>Opera</i> of king <i>Arthur</i>, was sung at the
play-house, half the gentlemen and ladies in the side boxes and pit got
an ague by it, thoâ€™ it was sung in the midst of the dog-days. Lastly, to
conclude, for I am afraid I have trespassâ€™d too much upon your patience,
we infinitely exceed the antients in quickening of parts: <i>Virgil</i>, one
of the topping wits of antiquity, was forcâ€™d to retire out of the noise
and hurry of <i>Rome</i> to his country <i>Villa</i>, and bestowâ€™d some ten or
twelve years in composing his <i>Ã†neis</i>: whereas Sir <i>Richard Blackmore</i>,
who passes but for a sixth rate versifier among us, was able to write
both his <i>Arthurs</i> in two or three years time, and that in the tumult
and smoak of Coffee-houses, or in his coach as he was jolting it from
one patient to another, amidst the vast multiplicity of his business
too, which as the city bard frankly confesses, was never greater than
then.</p>

<p>The gentleman delivered his ironies with so good a grace that he set all
the company a laughing, and for that time put an end to the dispute. And
now since I am upon the chapter of Sir <i>Richard</i>, you must know, that
the young wits, inhabiting upon the banks of <i>Phlegethon</i>, have lately
pelted his <i>Arthurs</i> with distichs; but I can only call to mind at
present three of them. The two first reflect upon the poemâ€™s genealogy,
which was partly begot in a coffee-house, and partly in a coach.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">{276}</a></span></p>

<p>I do not wonder now at prince <i>Arthur</i>â€™s wonderful loquacity, says
another, (for as I remember, when he and king <i>Hoel</i> met upon the road,
he welcomes him with a simile of forty lines perpendicular) since he was
born at a coffee house; nor at the rumbling of the verse, since one half
of the book was written in a leathern vehicle; for we find, continues
he, that what is bred in the bone, will never out of the flesh; and
thus, â€™tis no wonder, that according to the observation of a modern
virtuoso, the <i>Severn</i> is so mischievous and cholerick a river, and so
often ruins the country with sudden inundations, since it rises in
<i>Wales</i>, and consequently participates sometimes of the nature of that
hasty, iracund people among whom â€™tis born. However, cries surly <i>Ben</i>,
I must needs commend Sir <i>Richard</i>â€™s sagacity and politicks in taking
care that his muse should be so openly deliverâ€™d; for Epic poems, like
the children of sovereign princes, ought to be born in publick.</p>

<p>The other day, as I was taking a solitary turn by myself, â€™twas my
fortune to meet with a leash of old-fashionâ€™d thread-bare mortals, with
very dejected looks, and in the best equipage of those worthy gentlemen,
whom you may see every day between the hours of twelve and one, walking
in the <i>Middle-Temple</i> and <i>Grays-Inn</i> walks, to get â€™em a stomach to
their no-dinners. At first I took them for a parcel of fiddlers, when
the oldest of them undeceivâ€™d me, by addressing himself to me as
follows. Sir, says he, my name is <i>J. Hopkins</i>, my two companions are
the famâ€™d <i>Sternhold</i> and <i>Wisdom</i>, and understanding that you are
lately arrived from <i>England</i>, I have presumâ€™d to ask you a question: we
have been informâ€™d some time ago, that two <i>Hibernian</i> bards, finding
fault with our version and language, have endeavourâ€™d to depose myself
and my two bre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_277">{277}</a></span>thren here out of all parish-churches, where we have
reignâ€™d most melodiously so long, and to substitute their own
translation in the room of it; I must confess it vexes me to the heart
to think that I must be ejected after an hundred years quiet possession
and better, which, by the Common as well as Civil law, gives a man a
just title, and resign my ecclesiastical dominions to two new fangled
usurpers, whom I never injurâ€™d in my days. Now, Sir, pray tell me how my
affairs go in your world, and whether I have reputation enough still
left me with the people, to make head against those unrighteous
innovators? Why truly, Mr. <i>Hopkins</i>, says I to him, when these
adversaries first appeared in the world, I was in some pain about you,
the conspiracy against your crown and dignity being so speciously laid,
that nothing less than an universal defection seemâ€™d to threaten you.
â€™Tis true indeed, some few churches in and about <i>London</i>, where the
people you know are governâ€™d by a spirit of novelty, have thrown you
out, but by what advices I can receive, excepting some few revolters,
the generality of the people seem to be heartily engaged in your
interests, and as it always happens to other monarchs when they are able
to surmount an insurrection formâ€™d against them, I look upon your
throne, since you have so happily broke the neck of this rebellion, to
be settled upon a surer basis than ever. The Parish-clerks, sextons, and
old women, all over the kingdom are in a particular manner devoted to
your service, preserving a most entire and unshaken allegiance to you,
and on my conscience would sooner part with all <i>magna charta</i> than one
syllable of yours. You wonderfully revive my spirits, replies old
<i>Hopkins</i>, to tell me such comfortable news, but pray, Sir, one word
more with you; This new translation that has made such a noise in the
world, is it so much superior to mine, as my enemies here would make me
believe? Mr. <i>Hopkins</i>, says I, I flatter no man, â€™tis not my way,
therefore you must not take amiss what I am going to say to you. For my
part I am of opinion, that king <i>David</i> is not obligâ€™d to any of you,
but ought to cudgel you all round; for I can find no other difference
between the <i>Jewish</i> monarch in his ancient collar of <i>ekes</i> and <i>ayes</i>,
which you and your brethren there have bestowâ€™d upon him, and in his
new-fashionâ€™d <i>Irish</i> dress, than there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_278">{278}</a></span> between an old man of
threescore with a long beard hanging down to his waste, and the same
individual old man newly come out of a barberâ€™s shop nicely shavâ€™d and
powderâ€™d. â€™Tis true, he looks somewhat gayer and youth-fuller, but has
not a jot more vigour and ability.</p>

<p>I know you gentlemen of <i>Will</i>â€™s coffee-house, will be glad to hear some
news of Mr. <i>Dryden</i>, I must tell you then, that we had the devil all of
combustions and quarrels here in hell since that famous bardâ€™s arrival
among us. The <i>Grecians</i>, the <i>Romans</i>, the <i>Italians</i>, the <i>Spaniards</i>,
the <i>French</i>, but especially the <i>Dutch</i> authors, have been upon his
back; <i>Homer</i> was the first that attackâ€™d him for justifying
<i>Almanzor</i>â€™s idle rants and monstrous actions by the precedent of
<i>Achilles</i>. The two poets, after a little squabbling, were without much
difficulty perswaded to let their two heroes fight out the quarrel for
them, but the nimble-heelâ€™d <i>GrÃ¦cian</i> soon got the whip-hand of the
furious <i>Almanzor</i>, and made him beg pardon. <i>Horace</i> too grumbled a
little in his gizzard at him for affirming <i>Juvenal</i> to be a better
satirist than himself; but upon second thoughts thought it not worth his
while to contest the point with him. Once it happenâ€™d, that Mr. <i>Bays</i>
came into our room when <i>Petronius Arbiter</i> was diverting us with a very
fine <i>nouvelle</i>. Mons. <i>Fontaine</i>, Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>, Mr. <i>Waller</i>, my
late lord <i>Rochester</i>, with Sir <i>Charles Sidley</i>, composâ€™d part of this
illustrious audience; when Mr. <i>Dryden</i> unluckily spoilâ€™d all by asking
the latter, what the facetious gentlemanâ€™s name was, that talkâ€™d so
agreeably? How, says Sir <i>Charles Sidley</i>, hadst thou the impudence, in
the preface before thy <i>English Juvenal</i>, to say, that so soon as the
pretended <i>Belgrade</i> supplement of <i>Petronius</i>â€™s fragments came into
<i>England</i>, thou couldst tell upon reading but two lines of that edition,
whether it was genuine or no; and here hast thou heard the noble author
himself talk above an hour by the clock, and could not find him out?
Upon this the old bard retired in some disorder; but what happened to
him a day or two after was more mortifying.</p>

<p><i>Chaucer</i> meets him in one of our coffee-houses, and after the usual
ceremonies were over between two strangers of their wit and learning,
thus accosts him. Sir, cries <i>Chaucer</i>, you have done me a wonderful
honour to furbish up some of my old musty tales, and bestow modern
garni<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_279">{279}</a></span>ture upon them, and I look upon myself much obliged to you for so
undeserved a favour; however, Sir, I must take the freedom to tell you,
that you over-strainâ€™d matters a little, when you likenâ€™d me to <i>Ovid</i>,
as to our wit and manner of versification. Why, Sir, says Mr. <i>Dryden</i>,
I maintain it, and who then dares be so saucy as to oppose me? But under
favour, Sir, cries the other, I think I should know <i>Ovid</i> pretty well,
having now conversâ€™d with him almost three hundred years, and the
devilâ€™s in it if I donâ€™t know my own talent, and therefore thoâ€™ you pass
a mighty compliment upon me in drawing this parallel between us, yet I
tell you there is no more resemblance between us, as to our manner of
writing, than there is between a jolly well-complexionâ€™d <i>Englishman</i>
and a black-hairâ€™d thin-gutted <i>Italian</i>. Lord, Sir, says <i>Dryden</i> to
him, I tell you that youâ€™re mistaken, and your two styles are as like
one another as two Exchequer tallies. But I, who should know it better,
says <i>Chaucer</i>, tell you the contrary. And I, say Mr. <i>Bays</i>, who know
these things better than you, and all the men in the world, will stand
by what I have affirmâ€™d, and upon that gave him the lye. <i>Rhadamanthus</i>,
who is one of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s oldest judges and a severe regulator of good
manners and conversation, immediately sent for our friend <i>John</i> to
appear in court; and after he had severely reprimanded him for using
such insufferable language upon no provocation; for your punishment,
says he, I command you to get Sir <i>Richard Blackmore</i>â€™s translation of
<i>Job</i> by heart, and to repeat ten pages of it to our friend the author
of the <i>Rehearsal</i> every morning. Poor <i>Bays</i> desired his lordship to
mitigate so rash a sentence, and by way of commutation frankly offerâ€™d
to drink so many quarts of liquid sulphur every morning. No, says my
lord judge, thoâ€™ they commute penances in <i>Doctors-Commons</i>, yet we are
not such rogues to commute them in hell, and so I expect to be obeyâ€™d.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Gentlemen</i>, you see we observe a severe justice among us, and
indeed to deliver my thoughts impartially, I must needs say, that equity
is administerâ€™d after a fairer and more compendious manner in these
dominions, than either in your <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, or your palace at
<i>Paris</i>, where <i>AstrÃ¦a</i> pretends to carry all before her, yet has as
little to do in either of those two places, as a farrier at<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_280">{280}</a></span> <i>Venice</i>. A
signal instance of this we have had in a late famous tryal. A
foot-soldier of the first regiment of guards, and a <i>Drury-lane</i> whore,
were summonâ€™d to appear before judge <i>Minos</i>, who after he had, with a
great deal of patience, heard the crimes that were alledgâ€™d against
them, asked them what they had to offer in favour of themselves, why
sentence of damnation should not pass? the young harlot, either replying
upon the merits of her face, which she foolishly imaginâ€™d would bring
her off here, as it had often done in your world, or else being
naturally furnishâ€™d with a greater stock of impudence than the soldier,
broke throâ€™ the crowd, and thus addressâ€™d herself to the court: I hope
your lordship, says she, will take no advantage of a poor womanâ€™s
ignorance, who ought to have learned counsel to plead for her; however,
I depend so much upon the justice of my cause, that I will undertake it
my self. The chief argument I insist upon, my lord, is this: I think it
highly unreasonable that I should suffer a-new for my crimes in this
world, having done sufficient penance for them in the other. By my
auntâ€™s consent and privity, I was sold to an old libidinous lord, and
debauchâ€™d by him before I was fourteen; the noble peer kept me some four
months; then took occasion to pick a quarrel with me, and set me a drift
in the wide world, to steer my course as fortune should direct me. In
this exigence I was forcâ€™d to apply my self to a venerable old matron,
who finding me young and handsome, took me into her service, shammâ€™d me
upon her customers for a baronetâ€™s daughter of the <i>North</i>, and much I
was made of, and courted like a little queen; but, my lord, our
profession is directly opposite to all others, for too much custom
breaks us. In short, an officer in the army, whom <i>Pluto</i> rewarded for
his pains, taught me what <i>Fortune de la guerre</i> meant, so that I was
very fairly salivated before fifteen. Having got a little knowledge of
the world under this old matronâ€™s directions, who went more than halves
with me in every bargain, I thought it high time to trade for my self,
and told her one morning, that I was resolved to expose myself no longer
in her house. What you please as for that, replies this antient
gentlewoman, but first, my dear child, let us come to a fair account to
see how the land lies between us. Then stepping into the next room<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_281">{281}</a></span> she
shewâ€™d me a deal-board all be-scrawlâ€™d with round oâ€™s and cart-wheels in
ungodly chalk; then clapping on her spectacles, let me see, cries she,
for lodging, diet, washing, cloaths, linen, physick, <i>&amp;c.</i> you owe me
ten pounds, (which came up within a few transitory shillings of what I
had earned in her house) and this you must pay, sweetheart, before you
talk of parting. â€™Twas in vain to complain of her extortion, for besides
that she pleaded perscription for it, her arithmetick was infallible,
and she judgâ€™d for her self <i>en dernier ressort</i>. Thus I was turnâ€™d out
of doors, but having in the interim, while I stayâ€™d here, contracted a
small acquaintance with a sister of the quill that lodgâ€™d in
<i>Covent-Garden</i>, I repaired to her quarters, and continuâ€™d with her.
Between us, my lord, we acted the story of <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>, that
is, we were never visible together, but when she appeared above the
horizon, â€™twas bed-time with me; and when she kept her bed, â€™twas my
time to shine at the play-house. When either of us went abroad, we made
a fine show enough, but then we gratifyâ€™d our backs at the expence of
our bellies; cow-heel, tripe, a few eggs, or sprats, were our constant
regale at home, and upon holidays a chop of mutton roasted upon a
packthread in the chimney; and many a time when my sister and I wore
silver-lacâ€™d shoes our stockings wanted feet. I should trespass too much
upon your lordshipâ€™s patience, to tell you how I have been forcâ€™d to
shift my name as well as my quarters, to submit to the nauseous embraces
of every drunken tobacco-taking sot, that had half a crown in his pocket
to purchase me; and when I have been arrested for a milk-score not
exceeding the terrible sum of four shillings, to let an ill-lookâ€™d dog
of a <i>Moabite</i> enjoy me upon a founderâ€™d chair in a spunging-house to
procure my liberty. To this I should add, what unmerciful contributions
I was forcâ€™d out of my small revenue to pay to the conniving justices
clerks, the constable, the beadle, the tallyman, but especially to those
rascals the <i>Reformers</i>, whose business is not to convert, but only lay
a heavier tax upon poor sinners, and make iniquity shift its habitation
oftener than otherwise it would, I should never have done. In short, our
condition, my lord is like a frontier people that live between two
mighty monarchies, oppressâ€™d, squeezâ€™d, and plun<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_282">{282}</a></span>derâ€™d on all sides. By
that time I was one and twenty, I could number more diseases than years,
smoak and swear like a grenadier; and last <i>Bartholomew fair</i>, having
made a debauch in stummâ€™d claret and Dr. <i>Stevens</i>â€™s water, with an
attorneyâ€™s clerk, a fever seizâ€™d me next morning, and tript up my heels
in three days. How I was buried, that is to say, whether by the
contributions of the sister-hood or at the charge of the parish, I
cannot tell; but this, my lord, is a short and faithful account of my
life, and now I submit myself to the justice of this honourable court. I
will not pretend to vindicate my profession, but this I may venture to
affirm, that the world cannot live without us, and that a whore in the
business of love, is like farthings in the business of trade, which
(thoâ€™ they are not the legal coin of the nation) ought to be allowâ€™d and
tolerated, if it were only for the conveniency of ready change. Well,
says my lord, since â€™tis so, and your calling exposâ€™d you to so much
suffering, I hope you made your gallants pay for it? That you may be
sure I did, answers our damsel, I sold my maidenhead to fifteen several
customers, by the same token seven of them were <i>Jews</i>, and it pleases
me to think how I cheated those loggerheads in their own <i>Mosaical</i>
indications. I never parted with any of my favours, nay, not so much as
a clap <i>gratis</i>, except a lieutenant and ensign whom once I admitted
upon trust, by the same token they built a sconce, and left me in the
lurch. I always took care to secure my money first; thoâ€™ those
ungracious vipers of the army would rifle me now and then in spite of
all my precaution: for my lord, we whores are like the sea, what we gain
in one place we lose in another. Take her away, says my lord <i>Minos</i>,
take her away, see her fairly dipt every morning for this twelvemonth
over head and ears in good wholesome brimstone: to be both merchant and
merchandize, to sell her self for money and yet expect pleasure for it,
is worse exaction than was ever practised in <i>Lombard-street</i> or
<i>Cornhil</i>.</p>

<p>Our <i>Drury-lane</i> nymph was no sooner carried off, but the soldier
advanced forward, and thus told his tale: My lord, you are not to expect
a fine speech from me, I am a soldier, and we soldiers are men of
action, and not of words. I was a barberâ€™s prentice in the <i>strand</i>,
livâ€™d with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_283">{283}</a></span> him five years, got his maid with child, beat his wife for
pretending to reprove me, had run on score at all the painted lattices
in the neighbour-hood, and my circumstances being such, was easily
persuaded to turn gentleman-soldier. My captain promisâ€™d to make me a
serjeant the very moment after I was listed, but he servâ€™d me just as he
did his creditors, whom, to my certain knowledge, he left in the lurch.
Well, my lord, I followâ€™d him to <i>Flanders</i>, where I stood buff to death
and damnation four campaigns, sometimes for a groat, sometimes for
nothing a-day. Had I more sins to answer for than either the colonel or
agent of our regiment, I have bustled throâ€™ misery enough to wipe out
all my scores, curtailâ€™d of my pay to keep a double-chinnâ€™d chaplain,
who never preachâ€™d among us, and maintain an hospital, where I could
never expect to be admitted without bribery; forcâ€™d for want of
subsistence to steal offal, which an hungry dog would piss upon, and if
discoverâ€™d sure to be rewarded with the wooden-horse, and lest the
unweildy beast shouâ€™d throw me, securâ€™d by a brace of musquets dangling
on my heels; to lie up to the chin in water for preventing of
rheumatisms, and smoak wholesome dock-leaves to prevent being dunnâ€™d by
my stomach; drubbâ€™d and canâ€™d without any provocation, by a smooth-facâ€™d
prig, who tâ€™other day was a pimp, or something worse to a nobleman;
never sure of one hourâ€™s rest in the night, never certain of a mealâ€™s
meat in the day; harassâ€™d with perpetual marches and counter marches;
roasted all the summer, and frozen all the winter; cheated by my
officer, cuckolded by my comrades. These, my lord, were the blessings of
my life, and if ever I could muster up pence enough to purchase a single
pint of <i>Geneva</i>, I thought myself in my kingdom. Last summer I was one
of the noble adventurers that went in the expedition to <i>Cadiz</i>, and
having securâ€™d a little linen to myself at <i>Fort St. Mary</i>â€™s in order to
make me a few shirts when I came home, and rubbâ€™d off with two
insignificant silver puppets (I think they call them saints) out of a
church, the superior commander seizâ€™d upon them for his own private use,
in her majestyâ€™s name, and legally plunderâ€™d me of what I had as legally
stolen from the enemy. This and a thousand other disappointments,
together with change of climates and other inconveniences,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_284">{284}</a></span> threw such a
damp upon my spirits, that within three days after I landed at
<i>Portsmouth</i>, I fell ill, and was glad to part with a wretched life,
which had given me so much vexation and so little satisfaction. Thus my
lord, I have honestly laid all before you, so let the court sentence me
as they please. Why really, says the judge, thy case is hard enough, and
I must needs say thou dost not want any new weight to be laid upon thee;
and so immediately acquitted him, ordering him to be set at liberty
without paying of fees.</p>

<p>Finding justice impartially administered in <i>Hell</i>, you may perhaps have
the curiosity, gentlemen, to enquire what sort of reception my lord
<i>Double</i> of <i>Turn-about-hall</i> found among us upon his arrival into these
dominions. I must tell you then, that to the universal admiration of our
infernal world, my lord is become <i>Pluto</i>â€™s great favourite, so that
nothing almost is transacted here without his advice and direction.
Every body indeed expected, that his lordship who changed his religion
on purpose to delude the unhappy prince, whose prime confident he was,
and at the same time kept a private correspondence with his enemy in
<i>Holland</i>, would have found an entertainment suitable to his deserts,
been loaded with chains, and regaled with liquid sulphur; but hitherto
he has either had the good luck, or management, to avoid it. A sudden
gust of wind had blown away the fan from the top of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s kitchin,
that very afternoon he came here. Our monarch was first in the mind to
clap his lordshipâ€™s breech upon the iron-spike, and make a weathercock
of him (the only thing he was fit for) that with every whiff of
brimstone he might tell where damnation sate. Soon after he was of
opinion to make a light-match of him to use upon occasion, whenever he
had any empire or kingdom to blow up. But at last carefully considering
his face, and the majesty of his gate, he made him his taylor, and to
say the truth, nobody knows the dimensions of his <i>Luciferian</i> majesty
better than his lordship: and as it often happens in your world for
noblemen to be governâ€™d by their taylors or peruke-makers, so my lord in
his present capacity of taylor orders every thing at court, puts in and
displaces whom he pleases, and possesses <i>Pluto</i>â€™s ear to that degree,
that happening to be in company last week with <i>Aaron<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_285">{285}</a></span> Smith</i>, Col.
<i>Wildman</i>, <i>Slingsby Bethel</i>, <i>C&#8212;rn&#8212;sh</i>, and others of the same
kidney, who heartily wish the prosperity of old <i>Hell</i>, they gravely
shook their heads, and said they were afraid their master <i>Pluto</i>â€™s
government would not long continue, since he had got a viper in his
bosom, and a traytor in his cabinet, who would not fail to conjure up
some neighbouring prince against him to dispossess him of his antient
throne. Indeed â€™tis prodigious to consider how this dissembler has
wriggled himself into the good opinion not only of our sovereign, but
even of queen <i>Proserpine</i>. About a month ago he had interest enough to
get my late lord <i>Sh&#8212;ft&#8212;ry</i>, released out of the dungeon, where he has
been confined ever since his coming here, and made him administrator of
the <i>Clyster-Pipe</i> to <i>Pluto</i>, for this merry reason, because he had
always a good hand at <i>striking at fundamentals</i>. That old libidinous
civilian of the <i>Commons</i>, Dr. <i>Littleton</i>, he has made judge admiral of
the <i>Stygian</i> lake, and the famous Mr. <i>Alsop</i>, who wished in his
address to king <i>James</i>, that the dissenters had casements to their
breasts, he has got to be the devilâ€™s glazier; nay, what will more
surprize you, he has procurâ€™d the reversion of master of <i>Pluto</i>â€™s rough
game, when it falls, for Dr. <i>Oates</i>; and obtainâ€™d a promise of
candle-snuffer-general to all the gaming-houses in these quarters, for
honest <i>George Porter</i> the evidence.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span><i>Imothy Addlepate</i>, of <i>Cheapside</i>, <i>Milliner</i>, was so wonderfully
afflicted with the <i>Zelotypia Italica</i>, that he constantly lockâ€™d up his
simpering red-hairâ€™d spouse, when business callâ€™d him abroad, and would
hardly trust her with her aunt or grandmother. By rectifying his
constitution with my true <i>Covent-Garden</i> <span class="smcap">Elixir</span>, he is so intirely
cured of the <i>Icterus Martialis</i>, or his old <i>yellow distemper</i> that now
of his own accord he carries her to the play-house, sends her to all the
balls, masquerades, and merry meetings in town; nay, trusts her alone at
<i>Epsom-Wells</i> and <i>Richmond</i>, and will let her sit a whole afternoon
with a gay smooth-facâ€™d officer of the guards at the tavern, and is
never disturbed at it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_286">{286}</a></span></p>

my <i>Antiverminous Powder</i>, voided above 30000 worms of all sorts, as
your <i>Ascarides</i>, <i>Teretes</i>, <i>Hirudines</i>, and so forth, in the space of
12 hours, one of which, by modest computation, was supposed long enough
to reach from St. <i>Leonardâ€™s Shoreditch</i>, to <i>Tottenham high cross</i>. I
confess my medicine is a little bitter; but what says the learned
<i>Arabian</i> philosopher <i>Hamet Ben Hamet Ben Haddu Albumazar</i>, A diadem
will not cure the <i>Apoplexy</i>, nor a velvet slipper the <i>Gout</i>: And are
not all the Antients as well as Neotorics agreed, that <i>raro corpus sine
vermibus</i>. Therefore, my good friends, be advisâ€™d in time.</p>

<p><i>Ezekiel Driver</i> of <i>Puddle-dock</i>, Carman, having disordered his <i>Pia
mater</i> with too plentiful a morningâ€™s draught of <i>three-threads</i> and
<i>old Pharaoh</i>, had the misfortune to have his car run over him. The
whole street concluded him as good as dead, and the over-forward clerk
of the parish had already set him down in the weekly-bills. Two
applications of my <i>Unguentum Traumaticum</i> set him immediately to
rights, and now he is coachman in ordinary to a Tallymanâ€™s fat widow in
<i>Soho</i>. Witness his hand <i>E. D.</i></p>

<p><i>Elnathan Ogle</i>, Anabaptist-teacher in <i>Morefields</i> over-against the
<i>Grasshopper</i> and <i>Greyhound</i>, for want of being carefully rubbâ€™d down
by the pious females after his sudorifick exercise, had got the grease
in his heels, and was so violently troubled with rheumatical pains, that
he was no longer able to lay out himself for the benefit of his
congregation. My <i>Emplastrum Anodynum</i> so effectually relievâ€™d him by
twice using of it, that he has since shifted his profession, teaches the
youth of <i>Finsbury-fields</i> to play at back-sword and quarter-staff, and
has turnâ€™d his conventicle in-for a fencing-school.</p>

<p><i>Marmaduke Thummington</i>, at the <i>Red-cow</i> and <i>3 Travellers</i> in
<i>Barbican</i>, was possessâ€™d with an obstreperous ill conditionâ€™d devil of
a wife, whose everlasting clack incessantly thundering in his ears, had
made him as deaf as a drum. His case was so lamentable, that a
demiculverin shot over his head affected him no more than it would a man
20 miles off; he was insensible to all the betting and swearing of the
loudest cock-match, that ever was fought by two conten<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_287">{287}</a></span>ding counties;
nay, at one of Mr. <i>Bays</i>â€™s fighting plays, would sit you as
unconcernâ€™d, as if he had been at a Quakers silent meeting. After all
your <i>Elmys</i>, and other pretenders had despairâ€™d of him, I undertook his
cure, and with a few of my <i>Otacoustical</i> drops have so intirely
recoverâ€™d him, that the society of Reformers have made him their chief
director, and his hearing is so strangely improved, that at an
eaves-dropping at a window, he can hear oaths that were never sworn, and
bawdy that was never spoke.</p>

<p><i>Richard Bentlesworth</i>, superintendent of a small grammar-elaboratory,
in the out-skirts of the town, was so monstrously over-run with the
<i>Scorbuticum Pedanticum</i>, that he used to dumfound his milk-woman with
strange stories of <i>gerunds</i> and <i>participles</i>; would decline you
<i>domus</i> in a cellar in the <i>Strand</i> before a parcel of chimney-sweepers,
and confute <i>Schioppius</i> and <i>Alvarez</i> to the old wall-eyâ€™d matron, that
sold him grey pease. Thoâ€™ this strange distemper, when once it has got
full possession of a man, is as hard to be cured as an hereditary-pox,
yet I have absolutely recovered him; so that now he troubles the publick
no more with any of his <i>Dutch-Latin</i> dissertations; but is as quiet an
author as ever was neglected by all the town, or buried in
<i>Little-Britain</i>.</p>

<p><i>Timothy Gimcrack</i>, doctor of the noble cockle-shell-fraternity, whose
philosophy and learning lay so much under ground, that he had nothing of
either to show above it, used to be troubled with strange unaccountable
fits, and during the <i>paroxism</i>, would contrive new worlds, as boys
build houses of cards, find a thousand faults with old <i>Moses</i>, make a
hasty pudding of the universe, and drown it in a <i>Menstruum</i> of his own
inventing, and leave the best patient in the city, for a new gay-coated
butterfly. I took out his brains, washed them in my <i>Aqua
Intellectualis</i>, and if has since relapsâ€™d, who may he thank, but his
cursed <i>East-India</i> correspondent, who addled his understanding a-new,
with sending him the furniture of a <i>Chinese</i> barberâ€™s-shop.</p>

<p><i>Nehemiah Drowsy</i>, grocer and deputy of his ward, was so prodigiously
afflicted with a lethargy, that his whole life was little better than a
dream. He would sleep even while he was giving the account of his own
pedigree,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_288">{288}</a></span> how from leathern breeches and nothing in them, he came to
the vast fortune he now possesses. Nay, over the pious spouse of his
bosom he has been often found asleep in an exercise which keeps all
other mortals awake. By following my sage directions heâ€™s so wonderfully
alterâ€™d for the better, that after a full dinner of roast-beef and
pudding he can listen to a dull sermon at <i>Salters-Hall</i>, without so
much as one yawn; nay, can hear his apprentice read two entire pages of
<i>Wesley</i>â€™s heroic poem, and never makes a nod all the while.</p>

<p>But to come to affairs of a more publick concern, we are in a strange
ferment here about the divided interests of the houses of <i>Austria</i> and
<i>Bourbon</i>. Our master following herein the policy of the <i>Jesuits</i>, or
rather they following him, for we ought to give the devil his due, seems
to incline most to the latter: however, if the <i>Spaniards</i> and <i>French</i>
set up their horses no better in your world than they do with us, â€™tis
easy to predict that the unnatural conjuction of the two kingdoms will
be soon shatterâ€™d to pieces. Whenever they meet, thereâ€™s such roaring
and swearing, and calling of names between them, that we expect every
minute when they will go to loggerheads. â€™Tis true some few of the dons
that are lately arrivâ€™d here, callâ€™d <i>Lewis-le-Grand</i> their protector,
and are <i>Frenchifyâ€™d</i> to a strange degree; but the rest of their
countrymen call them a parcel of degenerate rascals, and are so
violently bent against them, that unless <i>Pluto</i> lockâ€™d them up a nights
in distinct apartments, we should have the devil and all to do with
them.</p>

<p>Next to the affairs of <i>France</i> and <i>Spain</i>, are we concerned about the
fate of the occasional bill; a few old fashionâ€™d virtuosos among us hope
it will pass, but the generality of our politicians, and particularly
those belonging to <i>Pluto</i>â€™s cabinet, who are stiled the congregation
<i>de inferno ampliando</i>, are resolvâ€™d at any rate to hinder its taking
effect. As hypocrisy sends greater numbers to hell, than any other sins
whatever, you are not to wonder if the ministry here do all they can to
oppose the passing of a bill, which will prove so destructive to the
infernal interest by destroying hypocrisy. For which reason <i>Pluto</i> has
lately dispatchâ€™d several trusty emissaries to your parts, who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_289">{289}</a></span> to
bribe your observators and other mercenary pamphleteers, to raise a
hedious outcry about persecution, and represent this design in such
odious colours to the people, that, if posible, it may miscarry. A
little time will show us the success of this refinâ€™d conduct.</p>

<p>One short story, gentlemen, and then I have done. A <i>Spaniard</i> last week
was commending the authors of his own country, and particularly enlargâ€™d
upon the merits of the voluminous long-winded <i>Tostatus</i>, who, he said,
had writ above a cart-load of books in his time. But why should I talk
of a cart-load, continues he, when he has writ more than â€™tis possible
for any one single man to read over in his life? judge then of the worth
of this indefatigable <i>Tostatus</i>; judge how many tedious nights and days
he must have spent in study. Under favour, cries an <i>English</i> gentleman
lately arrived here, we have a writer that much exceeds your famous
<i>Tostatus</i>, even in that respect. His name is <i>Bentivoglio</i>, and thoâ€™ at
present he falls somewhat short of your author, as to the number of
books of his own composing, yet he has writ one octavo, which Iâ€™ll defy
any man in the universe to read over, thoâ€™ he has the patience of <i>Job</i>,
the constitution of <i>Sampson</i>, and the long age of <i>Methuselah</i>.</p>

<p>But hold&#8212;I forget who I am writing to all this while; gentlemen that
have either more business or pleasure upon their hands, than to go throâ€™
the tedious persecution of so unmerciful a letter. However, I hope
youâ€™ll pardon me this fault, if you consider the great difficulty of
transmitting the <i>nouvelles</i> of our subterranean world to your parts;
for which reason I was resolvâ€™d rather to trespass upon your patience,
than lose this opportunity of giving you an account of all our memorable
transactions. If in requital of this small trouble I have given myself,
you will be so kind as to order any one of your society, to inform me
how affairs go at present in <i>Covent-Garden</i>, at St. <i>James</i>â€™s &amp;c. what
news the dramatick world affords in <i>Drury-lane</i>, <i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>,
and <i>Smithfield</i>, as â€™twill be the most sensible obligation you can lay
upon me, so it shall be rememberâ€™d with the utmost gratitude by,</p>

<h3>LETTER I.</h3>

<p class="c"><i>To Mr.&#8212;&#8212; at his Chambers in&#8212;&#8212; College in</i> Cambridge.</p>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><i><span class="letra">I</span>Ngatum fi dixere omnia dixeris</i>, was the saying of one of the greatest
sages of antiquity; to whose name and merits I presume you can be no
stranger. <i>Perit quod facias ingrato</i>, was likewise the saying of
another <i>GrÃ¦cian</i> philosopher, as you will find in <i>Erasmus</i>â€™s adagies.
<i>Save a thief from the gallows and heâ€™ll cut your throat</i>, is a proverb
of our own growth; and we have a thousand in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_291">{291}</a></span>stances in antient and
modern history to confirm the truth of it.</p>

<p>Indeed ingratitude is so monstrous and execrable a vice, that, according
to the <i>Roman</i> oratorâ€™s observation (I need not tell you, that when I
say the <i>Roman</i> orator, I always mean <i>Tully</i>) the very earth itself,
the <i>bruta tellus</i>, as <i>Horace</i> deservedly calls it, is a standing
testimony against all ungrateful men, and rises up in judgment against
them. For does not this earth, the vilest of the four elements, make
grateful returns to the husbandman for the little cost and pains he
bestows upon her? Does she not sometimes give thirty, sometimes twenty,
and at least ten measures of corn for the one he entrusted her with?
Whereas an ungrateful wretch is so far from doubling or trebling a
kindness done to him, that â€™tis next door to a miracle, if he can be
brought to give back the principal.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, youâ€™ll ask me, I suppose, what I mean by declaming thus
againgst ingratitude, any more than simony or sacrilege, or any other
sin whatever; and particularly how this comes to affect you? Why, Sir,
donâ€™t be so hasty, I beseech you, and youâ€™ll soon be satisfied.</p>

<p>You must understand me then, that one Mrs. <i>Rebecca Blackman</i>, widow,
who lives at the sign of the <i>Griffin</i> in <i>Shoe-lane</i>, (I suppose, Sir,
somebodyâ€™s conscience begins to fly in his face by this time) told me,
that a certain gentleman of <i>Cambridge</i>, who very much resembles you in
name, face, and person, (and now Sir, I humbly conceive that somebody
that shall be nameless blushes) borrowâ€™d of her upon the first of
<i>April</i>, 1698, in the tenth year of his majesty king <i>William</i>â€™s reign,
the sum of five pounds, (well Sir, let him blush on, for blushing is a
sign of grace) which he promisâ€™d to repay her <i>in verbo sacerdotis</i>,
within a month after, (good Lord! to see how canonically some people can
break their words) upon the word of a gentleman, as he was a christian,
and all that. But mind what follows, Sir. This worthy gentleman, I told
you of, althoâ€™ he was bound to the performance of his promise by all
that was good and sacred; and if good and sacred would not bind him, by
a note under his own hand, wherein he promisâ€™d to pay to Mrs. <i>Rebecca
Blackman</i>, widow, or order, the aforesaid sum of five pounds upon
demand; nevertheless, and notwithstanding all this, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_292">{292}</a></span> has not had the
manners so much as to send her a letter to excuse himself for this
delay, and takes no more notice of her, than if he had never seen any
such person as Mrs. <i>Rebecca Blackman</i> in all his life.</p>

<p>She being therefore my antient acquaintance and friend, and one for whom
I profess to have a very great value, desirâ€™d me to write a few lines to
you, which accordingly I have done, and by her order I request you, as
being a person of great civility and candour, to tell the aforesaid
gentleman, (whom as I am informed you may see every morning in the year,
if you have a looking-glass in your room, which I will in charity
suppose) that she expects to have the five pounds <i>supradict</i> within a
fortnight at farthest, and then all will be well: otherwise she must be
forcâ€™d, in her own defence, to employ the secular arm, <i>anglicÃ¨</i>, a
baliff or catchpole, and put the abovementionâ€™d person into lobbâ€™s
pound.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, having a great regard to mother university, (of which I might
have been an unworthy member, had not my uncle&#8212;&#8212;) and likwise being
desirous to prevent farther effusion of christian money, I make it my
humble request to you to speak to the aforesaid gentleman, that he would
send me the sum of five pounds with all expedition; and in so doing you
will in a most particular manner oblige,</p>

</p>

<h3>ANSWER I.</h3>

<p><i>To Mr.</i> W. H. <i>Attorney at Law, at his Chambers in</i> Cliffordâ€™<i>s-Inn</i></p>

<p><i>Worthy Sir</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>Esterday morning, about eight of the clock precisely, the sun being
newly entred into <i>Sagittarius</i>, and the wind standing at south-east by
east; which corner, as the learned abbot <i>Joachimus Trithemius</i>, in his
elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_293">{293}</a></span> treatise, intitled, <i>Eurus Enucleatus</i>, tells us, is a
certain prognostick of droughts and hot weather; I was smoaking a pipe
of tobacco, and reading <i>Erasmus</i>â€™s <i>MoriÃ¦ Encomium</i> of the <i>Basil</i>
edition, printed by <i>Frobenius</i>, who, you know, Sir, married
<i>Christopber Plantin</i>â€™s cook-maid, when to my great surprize, the
post-boy brought me a letter from one <i>W. H.</i> who pretends to date it
from his chambers in <i>Clifford</i>â€™s-Inn; thoâ€™ as far as I can judge of the
beast by his stile and way of writing, he ought to have a room no where
but in the brick-house in <i>Moorfields</i>.</p>

<p>For, Sir, the author of it, and I desire you to tell him so much from
me, seems to rave, and in his raving fit disgorges old buckram
<i>Apophthegms</i> and ends of <i>Latin</i> stolen out of <i>Lycosthenes</i>; and in
short, at the expence of other folks, throws his thread-bare quotations
about him like a madman, as you will soon perceive, if youâ€™ll give
yourself the trouble to read what follows.</p>

<p>I. This retainer to the law, Sir, begins his letter with <i>Ingratum si
dixere omnia dixere</i>; and has the impudence to tell me, that it was a
saying of one of the greatest sages of antiquity, as if a man were a jot
the wiser for his calling him so; and, like a presuming coxcomb as he
is, presumes I am no stranger to his name and merits. Pray, Sir, tell
him from me, that he has falsifyâ€™d his quotation; for which crime, by an
old statute of king <i>Ina</i>, as you will find in <i>Gothofred</i> and
<i>Panormitanus</i>, he ought to do penance in a certain wooden machine,
callâ€™d in <i>Latin</i>, <i>Collistrigium</i>, and in <i>English</i> a <i>Pillory</i>; and
that in all the antient manuscripts both in the <i>Vatican</i> and <i>Bodleian</i>
libraries, not to mention those of the duke of <i>Courland</i>, and the
prince of <i>Hesse-Darmstadt</i>, â€™tis written, <i>Attornatum si dixeris, omnia
dixeris</i>; which is as much as to say, Sir, that if you call a man an
attorney, you call him all the rogues and rascals in the world.</p>

<p>II. Before I proceed any farther, I must beg the favour of you to inform
him, that we are much surprizâ€™d here to find an attorney guilty of so
much nonsense, as to send down <i>Latin</i> to the university, where we have
more than we know well what to do with. â€™Tis as bad as sending
<i>Derby</i>-ale from <i>Fullwood</i>â€™s-rents to the town of <i>Derby</i>, or sturgeon
to <i>Huntingdon</i>. In fine, as he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_294">{294}</a></span> managâ€™d matters, â€™tis downright
<i>murderium</i> (he knows the meaning of that word) for which he must never
expect the benefit of the clergy.</p>

<p>To pass over his next idle quotation, and an old batterâ€™d <i>English</i>
proverb; the next person he falls upon, is the <i>Roman</i> orator; and with
his usual discretion, he gives me to understand that he means <i>Tully</i> by
him. â€™Tis well he tells us whom he means; for of all the men in the
world, I thought an attorney had as little to do with an orator, as a
bawd with an eunuch. But why should a fellow that never meant any thing
in his life, pretend to meaning? Or how came <i>Tully</i> and such a
blockhead to be acquainted? Well, but <i>Tully</i>, he says, observes that
the earth itself, which, I hope by the bye, will one of these days stop
his pettifegging mouth, for calling it the vilest of the four elements,
is a standing testimony against ingratitude; and why forsooth, because
it returns the husbandman two for one. I canâ€™t imagine how it should
come into this wretchâ€™s head to rail at ingratitude, who is the most
ungrateful devil that ever livâ€™d; and â€™tis ten to one but I prove it
before I have done with him. He is ungrateful in the first place to his
schoolmaster, for making no better use of the <i>Latin</i> he wippâ€™d into
him. He is ungrateful to the <i>Common Law</i>, for polluting it which wicked
sentences purloinâ€™d out of <i>Pagan</i> authors: and lastly, he is ungrateful
to the <i>Inn</i> he lives in, for dreaming seven whole years there to no
purpose, and continuing as great a blockhead as when he first come to
town.</p>

<p>Towards the conclusion of his letter, <i>you must understand</i>, says he,
<i>that one</i>&#8212;This he said to show his civility and good manners; <i>You
must understand</i>? Why suppose I wonâ€™t <i>understand</i>, how will he help
himself? Or what man alive can understand a fellow that murders his
thoughts between two languages? but I find I must <i>understand</i> him right
or wrong. After this compliment, he tells me an idle foolish story of a
widow in <i>Shoe-lane</i>, and raves about five pounds, that I know nothing

<h3>LETTER II.</h3>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Donâ€™t know what plenty of <i>Latin</i> you may have in the <i>University</i>;
thoâ€™, by the bye, I can hardly believe you are so overstockâ€™d with it as
you pretend; but I dare swear that <i>good manners</i> are very scarce things
among you, and your letter sufficiently demonstrates it.</p>

<p>You are angry with me, it seems, for quoting a few <i>Latin</i> sentences; I
am afraid â€™tis the meaning of them, and not the language that disgusts
you; for some people canâ€™t endure to hear the truth told them in any
tongue whatever: but, under favour, <i>Sir</i>, what mighty virtue should
there be in the air of <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Cambridge</i>, that <i>Latin</i> should
only flourish there? Or why should not <i>Tully</i> take up his quarters in
the <i>Inns</i> of <i>Chancery</i>, as well as one of your <i>Colleges</i>? I am sure
we can give him better meat and drink, and perhaps have cleaner and
larger rooms to entertain him.</p>

</div>

<p>The meaning of these two verses are, (for why should not I interpret my
<i>Latin</i> to you, as well as you have taken the freedom to explain yourâ€™s
to me?) that <i>London</i> is not so barbarous and unpolishâ€™d a place, but
that <i>Apollo</i>, and the nine <i>Muses</i> may find as hospitable a reception
there, as with you in the university.</p>

<p>But, <i>Sir</i>, I have no time to lose, thoâ€™ you have. The widow is pressing
for her money, the <i>Term</i> draws on apace, and I must know your answer
one way or other. Therefore let me desire you in your next, not to
ramble from the point in hand, but to keep to the text. Once in your
life take <i>Martial</i>â€™s advice, <i>Dic aliquid de tribus capellis</i>; hereâ€™s
<i>Latin</i> for you again; but the advice is good and seasonable. Once more
leave off flourishing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_296">{296}</a></span> come immediately to business, that I may know

</p>

<h3>ANSWER II.</h3>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">Y</span>OU charge me with want of manners in the <i>University</i>. Now to convince
you that your accusation is groundless, frivolous and vexatious, I will
take no notice of the scurrilous reflections in your letter, but, as you
desire me, fall immediately to business.</p>

<p>To sum them up in a few lines what you have bestowâ€™d so many upon, you
tell me that a certain gentleman of my acquaintance, meaning myself, I
suppose, whom in your excess of charity, you believe to have a
looking-glass in his chamber, and a great deal of the like stuff,
borrowâ€™d five pounds last <i>April</i> of one <i>Rebecca Blackman</i>, widow, and
spinster, living at the sign of the <i>Griffin</i> and <i>Red-lion</i> in
<i>Shoe-lane</i>, and has not paid her as he promisâ€™d. Now, <i>Sir</i>, if I make
it appear to you that there is no such a thing as a widow <i>in rerum
natura</i>, or a <i>Griffin</i>, or a <i>Red-lion</i>; that <i>Shoe-lane</i> is an
equivocal word; and that â€™tis impossible for a man that lives under the
evangelical dispensation to owe any such <i>heathenish sum</i> as five
pounds; I hope youâ€™ll be brought to knock under the table, and own that
you have given me and yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p><i>First of all</i>, I affirm, assert and maintain, that there is no such
thing as a widow in the universe; and thus I prove it. A <i>widow</i> is one
that laments and grieves for the loss of her husband; but how can you or
any man in <i>London</i> know that a woman really grieves? for shedding of
tears, and wearing of crape, are not sure signs of grief; consequently
then how can you be sure there is any such thing as a widow? And if so,
are not you an insufferable coxcomb to palm a widow upon a stranger,
that never did you any harm? Well, but suppose it were possible for a
man to know that a woman really grieves for the loss of her husband,
which proposition, let me tell you, <i>Heroboord Burgersdicius</i>, and the
whole stream of the <i>Dutch</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_297">{297}</a></span> commentators and <i>Peleponnesian</i> divines
positively deny; how shall we be able to find out this monster, and tell
where the place of her abode is? Why, say you, she lives at the sign of
the <i>Griffin</i> and <i>Red Lion</i> in <i>Shoe-lane</i>? Bless us! what a sad thing
it is to be troubled with a distemperâ€™d brain! <i>Imprimis</i>, a <i>Griffin</i>
is a new <i>ens rationis</i>, only devisâ€™d by the imagination, and is no
where to be found, no not in the deserts of <i>Arabia</i>, or the vast
forests of <i>Afric</i>; althoâ€™ <i>Afric</i>, Sir, ever since the time of
<i>Eratosthenes</i> and <i>Strabo</i>, has been said continually to produce some
new monster: and as for a <i>Red Lion</i>, I defy you and all the attornies
in the kingdom to shew me one. <i>Theophrastus</i>, <i>Ã†lian</i>, <i>Dionysius</i>,
<i>Harmogistus de miraculis</i>, <i>Perogunius de brutis</i>, <i>Philopemen junior
de robusta natura</i>, and a hundred more of worth and credit, whom I have
read, and you never heard namâ€™d, either in <i>Westminster-hall</i>, or
<i>Westminster-abbey</i>. But since these are pagan authors, it may be you
will pretend they ought to have no weight with a christian, and I know
you will be damnâ€™d before you will allow of any thing against your own
mammon; therefore I shall proceed to give you more modern accounts of
what has been remarkâ€™d in the most natural places for to expect monsters
in, and yet the devil of a <i>Red Lion</i> do they mention. <i>Don Gonsales</i>
gives us a particular of all the wonders, miracles and strange things in
the habitable part of the moon; <i>Mandevil</i>â€™s <i>Travels</i>, <i>Piuto</i>â€™s and
<i>de la Val</i>â€™s, the most fabulous of the poets, the most lying pilgrims
and extravagant historians, never darâ€™d to have the impudence to impose
so much upon mankind as to assert the being of a <i>Red Lion</i>.</p>

<p>Now if human reason, experience in so many places, and no proof any
where can have place, as it ought to do with a lawyer, I hope here are
enough to convince you of your error; but if nothing under ocular
demonstration will satisfy you, and you are not at leisure to turn over
so many volumes, let me request you, worthy Sir, to take a step to the
tower, and if you donâ€™t find what I say to be true, I promise you here
under my hand to give you a hundred pounds, <i>bonÃ¦ &amp; legalis monetÃ¦
AngliÃ¦</i>, the next time I meet you.</p>

<p>However, for peace sake, let us once admit, that <i>Griffins</i> and <i>Red
Lions</i>, are real things, and no fictions of the brain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_298">{298}</a></span> as <i>Smeglesius</i>
hath evidently provâ€™d it, in what street or square, or lane, or alley,
is the abovementionâ€™d Mrs. <i>Rebecca Blackman</i> to be found? Oh, cry you
in <i>Shoe-lane</i>. Come Sir, <i>Shoe-lane</i> is a fallacy which you must not
pretend to put upon a man that has taken his own degrees, and writes
himself <i>A. M.</i> donâ€™t you know, that <i>dolus latet in universalibus</i>?
Whatever lane people walk in they must certaintly wear out shoe-leather;
and in whatever lane they wear out shoe-leather, that lane, in propriety
of speech, deserves and may challenge the name of <i>Shoe-lane</i>;
consequently then, every lane, not only in <i>London</i>, but in all his
majestyâ€™s dominions, where the subjects of <i>England</i> walk, and wear out
shoe-leather, may properly be callâ€™d <i>Shoe-lane</i>. Judge then whether
ever I shall be able to find out the true place where this widow lives
by the equivocal description you have given of it. As for my <i>Major</i>, I
defy you or any of your brethren in wicked parchment, to find out the
least hole in it. My <i>Minor</i> is as plain as the sun at noon-day; and you
may as well run your head against a brick-wall, as pretend to attack it;
and then the consequence must be good of course. I would take this
opportunity to shew the falshood and vanity of the remaining part of
your letter; but the bell-rings for supper: however, I shall take care
to do it next post; at which time you may certainly expect to hear
farther from</p>

<p class="r">
<i>Your most humble servant</i>,      Q. Z.<br />
</p>

<h3>ANSWER III.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Fully demonstrated to you in my last, that there was no such thing as
a <i>Widow</i>; or suppose there was, that it was morally impossible for a
man to know it. After this, I proceeded to show, that your <i>Griffin</i> was
romantick, your <i>Red Lyon</i> fabulous; and that <i>Shoe-lane</i> by being every
lane, was consequently no lane at all. Now, <i>Sir</i>, I come to consider
the following part of your letter, where with your usual ingenuity and
good manners, you tell me I am indebted the sum of five pounds to the
widow abovementionâ€™d; and I doubt not to lay open the vanity of this
allegation, as well as of those that preceded it. Sir, give me leave to
tell you, that â€™tis impossible that&#8212;should owe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_299">{299}</a></span> any such sum as five
pounds. Is it to be imaginâ€™d that a&#8212;should trespass against a plain
positive express text of scripture? This is what the worst of our
adversaries, either papists or other sectaries, of what title or
denomination soever, would not have the impudence to charge us with.
Does not St. <i>Paul</i> positively say, <i>Owe no man any thing but love</i>? How
then can I owe this chimerical widow of your own making that heathenish
sum called five pounds? Indeed if there is any such person, I owe her a
great deal of love, as the text commands me; but as for five pounds, I
owe it her not: and for this, as I have already observâ€™d to you, I can
produce a plain positive text of scripture, which I hope you will not be
so wicked as to deny.</p>

<p>In short, <i>Sir</i>, I am afraid that the law has discomposâ€™d your brain,
and this I conclude from your incoherent citations of <i>Latin</i>, your
raving of <i>Griffins</i> and <i>Red Lions</i>, of <i>Widows</i> and <i>five pounds</i>.
Therefore, thoâ€™ I am wholly a stranger to you, yet, as you are a native
of this kingdom, I heartily wish your cure, and shall do whatever lies
in my power to effect it, for which reason I desire you to take notice
of the following advice. It being now spring time, at which season
according to the observation of the learned <i>Zarabella</i> and
<i>Ciacconius</i>, the humours begin to ferment and float in all human
bodies, I would advise you to correct the saline particles, with which I
perceive your blood is overchargâ€™d, with good wholsome nettle-broth and
watergruel every morning alternately; but take care to put no currants
or sugar into your watergruel, because, as the judicious <i>Frenelius</i>, in
has <i>Diatriba de usu</i>, affirms, currants excite choler, and sugar has an
ill effect upon the diaphragm, glandula pinealis. Then, Sir, thrice a
week at least, refrigerate your intestines with good salutary clysters,
and take some eighteen ounces of blood away about two hours before the
clyster is administred to you. Above all let me conjure you to forbear
stuffâ€™d beef, salt fish, pepper and hot spices, and what is full as
pernicious as pepper and hot spices, the reading of any <i>Latin</i> authors,
for fear they should raise a new rebellion in the humours: sage and
butter, with a glass or two of clarifyâ€™d whey moderately taken in a
morning, may be of singular use. Go to bed early, and rise betimes. If
you live up to these directions, I do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_300">{300}</a></span> doubt but youâ€™ll be your own
man again in a little time. Having no farther interest in all this than
only effecting your cure, I persuade my self you will be so much your
own friend as to follow the advice of</p>

<i>Your humble Servant</i>,<br />
Q. Z.<br />
</p>

<h3>LETTER III.</h3>

<p><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>INCE you were so wonderfully kind in your last letter, as out of your
great liberality to honour me with some of your own directions, I am
resolvâ€™d not to be behind-hand with you in point of courtesy, and
therefore recommend the following rules to your consideration.</p>

<p>In the first place, I crave leave to inform you, that syllogisms and
sophistry pay no debts; That as old birds are not to be caught with
chaff, so a lawyer is not to be imposed upon by thin frothy arguments;
and that <i>Aristotle</i>, let him make never so great a figure in the
schools, has no manner of authority in <i>Westminster-hall</i>, where I can
assure you they wonâ€™t take his <i>ipse dixit</i> for a groat.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would advise you not to have so great an opinion of your own
parts, as to despise the rest of the world, and think to palm any of
your little banters upon them. â€™Tis enough in all conscience, I think,
that you take the liberty to dumfound us with your <i>Fathers</i> and
<i>Councils</i> in the pulpit, which we of the laity are forced to take upon
content; and therefore you may spare them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and lastly, When you run in any oneâ€™s debt, â€™tis my counsel,
and I give it you for nothing, that you would take care to see the party
satisfyâ€™d in good current money, for fear a wicked <i>Moabite</i> should
compel you to it, which, between friends, will not be much for your
reputation. As this is the last letter you are like to receive from me,
I make it once more my request to you to observe the contents of it: for
I am not at leisure to trifle any longer with you: otherwise a
stone-doublet is the word, and wars must ensue, which every good
christian ought to prevent, if it lies in his power. I am, unless you
give me further provocation,</p>

<p class="r">
<i>Your Humble Servant</i>,      W. H.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_301">{301}</a></span></p>

<p>P. S. <i>Your old friend the widow, is sorry to hear you have made so
familiar with her, as to call her being in question; as likewise that of
her</i> Griffin <i>and</i> Red Lion. <i>As for your love, having no occasion for
it at present, she desires you to bestow it elsewhere; but is resolvâ€™d,
notwithstanding all your learned quirks and quiddities, to get her five
pounds again; and when she has it in her pocket, for your sake sheâ€™ll
never trust it with a logician, that would</i> ergo <i>her out of what is her
own</i>.</p>

<h3>ANSWER IV.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span> Received your last, for which I return you my hearty thanks, and am
entirely of your opinion, that old birds are not to be caught with
chaff; I find, Sir, you are a great admirer of old proverbs, and I
commend you for it, for a great deal of morality and wholsome knowledge
is to be pickâ€™d out of them: besides, Sir, they are like the Common law
of <i>England</i>, and derive their authority from usage and custom. Now I am
talking of proverbs, there is one comes into my head at present, which I
desire you to ruminate or chew the cud upon. In short, â€™tis <i>Birds of a
feather flock together</i>, which is effectually and literally fulfillâ€™d
when an attorney and a pickpocket are in the same company.</p>

<p>I am likewise of opinion, worthy Sir, that what you say of <i>Aristotle</i>â€™s
making none of the best figures in <i>Westminster-hall</i>, may be true; for
how can that plodding animal callâ€™d a philosopher, expect civil quarter
from the sons of noise and clamour? But by the by, Sir, I must take the
freedom to tell you, that some of his friends here take it very ill,
that you the black guard of <i>Westminster-hall</i> will not take his word
for a groat. Sir, that diminutive contemptible piece of money a groat,
Sir, three of which go to the making up of that important sum,
denominated by the vulgar a shilling. Is it not very barbarous and
inhuman, that <i>Aristotle</i>, formerly tutor to the greatest monarch in the
universe, (when I say the greatest monarch in the universe, I neither
mean <i>Bajazet</i>, nor <i>Tamerlane</i>, nor <i>Scanderberg</i>, nor <i>Pipin</i>, nor yet
the <i>French</i> king, but <i>Alexander the great</i>) whose <i>ipse dixit</i> would
have formerly gone more current than our present <i>Exchequer</i> notes, or
<i>Malt</i> tickets, in any tavern, inn, or victualling-house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_302">{302}</a></span> between the
<i>Hellespont</i> and the <i>Ganges</i>, for a thousand pounds upon occasion: is
it not barbarous and inhuman, I say, that this same <i>Aristotle</i> should
not be trusted for a groat in <i>Westminster-hall</i>? That language one
would hardly have expected either from <i>Goth</i>, <i>Vandal</i>, or <i>Hun</i>, but
much less from a person of your civility and learning.</p>

<p>But alas! Sir, <i>Ã†tas parentum pejor avis</i>; we live in the fag-end of a
most degenerate ungrateful age, that has no regard to <i>Greek</i> or
<i>Latin</i>. <i>Oh tempora &amp; mores!</i> was the complaint of a great virtuoso two
thousand years ago, which we have but too much reason to renew now. Oh,
<i>Aristotle, Aristotle</i>! that I should ever live to see thy venerable
name in so much contempt, that any one belonging to <i>Westminster-hall</i>,
should have the impudence to say, he will not trust thee for a groat!
<i>Ultra Sauromatas fugere hinc libet.</i> I dare swear, that even in
<i>Muscovy</i> and <i>Poland</i>, none of the most hospitable countries in the
world, thou mayst at any time take a good dinner and a gallon of brandy
upon thy <i>Entilechia</i> and <i>Actus perspecui</i>, and yet in
<i>Westminster-Hall</i>, the most enlightenâ€™d hall of the most enlightenâ€™d
city of <i>Christendom</i>, thy <i>ipse dixit</i> in so much vogue formerly with
the <i>Thomists</i> and <i>Scotists</i>, the <i>Nominalists</i> and <i>Realists</i>, should
not pass for a groat! So much, <i>Sir</i>, by way of answer, to <i>Aristotle</i>
and <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, <i>ipse dixit</i>, and a groat.</p>

<p>What you say in a following paragraph concerning the wicked <i>Moabite</i>
and the <i>Stone Doublet</i>, is very picquant and ingenious: for, Sir,
reading Mr. <i>Hobbs</i>â€™s chapter about <i>Concatenation of Thought</i>, I find
there is a great connection between the <i>Moabite</i> and <i>Stone doublet</i>;
and some of the modern itineraries inform us, that stone doublets are in
mighty request with the people of those countries to this very day; and
the physical reason they assign for it, is, because stone doublets are
very refrigerating and alexpharmick, which undoubtedly is a great
refreshment in so hot a climate, as that where the wicked <i>Moabite</i>
lived.</p>

<p>But, <i>Sir</i>, in lieu of the advice, which, out of your great bounty and
liberality, you were pleasâ€™d to give me for nothing, be pleasâ€™d to
accept of the following character, which I give myself the trouble to
transcribe out of an ancient MS. in the <i>Cotton-Library</i>, supposâ€™d to be
written by the famous <i>Junius</i>, who for his great skill in the ori<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_303">{303}</a></span>ental
languages, acquirâ€™d the sirname of <i>Patricius</i>; and this character,
unless I am mistaken in my mathematicks, will give you a lively idea of
a certain beast you may perhaps be acquainted with.</p>

<p>An attorney is one that lives by the undoing of his neighbours, as
surgeons do by broken heads and claps, and like judges that always bring
rain with them to the assizes, is sure to bring mischief with him
wherever he comes. Heâ€™s an animal bred up by the corruption of the law,
nursâ€™d up in discord and contention, and has a particular cant to
himself, by which he terrifies the poor country people who worship him
as the <i>Indians</i> do the devil, for fear he should mischief â€™em. He is a
constant resorter to fairs and markets, and has a knack to improve the
least quarrel into a law-suit. He talks as familiarly of my lord chief
justice as if he had known him from his cradle, and threatens all that
incur his displeasure with leading them a jaunt to <i>Westminster-hall</i>.
If his advice be askâ€™d upon the most insignificant trifle, he nods his
head, twirls his pen in his ear, and cries â€™twill bear a noble action;
and when he has emptyâ€™d the poor wretchâ€™s pocket, advises him to make up
the matter, drink a merry cup with his adversary, and be friends. He
affects to be thought a man of business, and quotes statutes as
fiercely, as if he had read over <i>Keble</i> and got him by heart. The
catchpole is his constant companion, by the same token they are as
necessary to one another, as a midwife to a bawd, or an apothecary to a
grave physician. While he lives, he is a perpetual persecutor of all the
country about him; but fattens by being cursed, as they say camomile
grows by being trod upon. At last, the devil serves an execution upon
his person, hurries him to his own quarters, in whose clutches I leave
him.</p>

<p>If this character may be of any service to you, I shall heartily
rejoice, it being my highest ambition to approve my self,</p>

<p class="r">
<i>Your most</i>, &amp;c.      Q. Z.<br />
</p>

<h3>ANSWER V.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">N</span>AY, <i>Sir</i>, since you are so peremptory and all that, I have sent you my
last conclusive answer, and am resolvâ€™d to be plaguâ€™d with you no
longer. Hoping therefore that your worship is in good health, as your
humble servant is at this present writing, this comes to let you know
(nay donâ€™t startle, I beseech you) that I am fairly<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_304">{304}</a></span> and honestly dead
(oh! fy, Sir, why should you be discomposâ€™d at so small a matter as that
is) in short, dead to all intents and purposes as a door-nail; or if
that wonâ€™t serve your turn, as dead as <i>Methusalah</i>, or any of the
patriarchs before the flood. And because, Sir, I am in a very good
humour at present, and somewhat disposâ€™d to be merry (which youâ€™ll say
is somewhat odd in a dead man) and besides having a mighty respect for a
person of your worth and gravity, I will let you know what distemper I
dyâ€™d of, and give you the whole history of my illness from <i>Dan</i> to
<i>Beersheba</i>. Upon the <i>20th</i> of <i>July</i> last, old stile, I was invited to
a christning in a certain village in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, where I had the
honour of being vicar; and by a strange fatality was over-persuaded to
eat some custard, which is the most pernicious aliment in the world, but
especially in the dog-days. Since I have been in the <i>Elysian Fields</i>,
meeting with <i>Galen</i> and <i>Dioscorides</i> the other day, I told them my
case, and both of â€™em told me that custard had done my business. <i>Galen</i>
whisperâ€™d me in the ear, and told me that whatever sham stories the
historians had palmâ€™d upon the world <i>Trajan</i> got his death by nothing
but eating of custard at <i>Antioch</i>, and mentionâ€™d two or three other
eminent persons that had their heels tript up by that pernicious food.
<i>Dioscorides</i> added farther, that custard was destructive of the
intellect, and conjurâ€™d me that the next time I writ to any of my
acquaintance in <i>London</i>, I would desire them to present his most humble
service to my <i>Lord Mayor</i> and court of <i>Aldermen</i>, and advise â€™em as
from him to refrain from custard, because it obnubilated the
understanding, and was detrimental to the memory. So much by way of
digression, but now, Sir, to proceed in the history of my illness: this
eating of custard first of all gave me a cachexy, and â€™twas my
misfortune that there was no brandy to be had in the house, for in all
probability a cogue of true orthodox <i>Nantz</i>, would have corrected the
crudity of the custard. This cachexy in twelve hours turnâ€™d to a <i>Dolor
alvi</i>, that to a <i>Peripneumonia</i> in the <i>Diaphragm</i>, and that to an
<i>Epyema</i> in the <i>Glandula Pinealis</i>. Upon this a hundred other
distempers came pouring upon me like thunder and lightning, for you know
when a man is once going, <i>down with him</i> is the word; that very fairly
dispatchâ€™d me in four days, and so I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_305">{305}</a></span> dyâ€™d without a doctor to help to
dispatch me, or an attorney to make my will. A little before I troopâ€™d
off, I desirâ€™d my parishoners to bury me under the great church-spout
which accordingly they did, I thank â€™em forâ€™t, and upon every shower of
rain I find a refreshment by it; for you must know that when I was
living, I was very thirsty in my nature, and abounded in adust cholerick
humours.</p>

<p>I believe, Sir, you might have writ to a thousand and a thousand dead
men, who would never have given themselves the trouble to answer your
letters, or have been so communicative of their secrets as you have
found me; but, Sir, I scorn to act under-board. And if this donâ€™t
satisfy all your doubts, I can only wish I had you here with me, to give
you farther conviction.</p>

<p>And now Sir, let me desire you to put your hand to your heart, and
consider calmly and sedately with yourself, whether it be not illegal as
well as barbarous, to disturb the repose of the dead, and persecute them
in their very graves? You that are so full of your <i>Cases</i> and your
<i>Precedents</i>, tell me what <i>Case</i> or <i>Precedent</i> you can alledge to
justify so unrighteous a <i>Procedure</i>? Is it not a known maxim in law,
that death puts a stop to all <i>Processes</i> whatsoever, and that when a
man has once paid the great debt of nature, he has compounded for all
the rest? How then can you make me amends for the injuries you have done
me, and the great charges you have put me to? For upon the faith and
honour of a dead man, the very passage of your letters to this
subterranean world, has cost me above five pounds, the pretended sum you
charge me with. However, if Heaven will forgive you, for my part I do;
and to show you, that after so many horrid provocations I am still in
charity with you, I remain,</p>

<p class="nind"><i>Lucifer.</i> <span class="bigg">H</span>OLD! porter, shut the gates of this our angust court, that
we may not be thus throngâ€™d. Let no more come in, â€™till we have clearâ€™d
the bench of these numbers we have before us already.</p>

<p><i>Porter.</i> Mighty emperor, your commands shall be obeyâ€™d.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Now, my noble lords, set we ourselves to search and examine
what of late years brings daily such gluts and spring-tides of souls to
our infernal mansions, â€™specially at this time, when neither war,
famine, nor plague, are abroad in the upper world, or at least in that
part of it from whence I observe most of this gang arrive; <i>Europe</i> I
mean: if there were war, â€™twould be no wonder so many were damnâ€™d; the
liberties of the sword surprize enough in their sins to throng our
courts of justice: nor is the plague without advantages for us that way;
the few that have spiritual relief, in such contagious and
quickly-destroying distempers, encrease our crop: and the general
cruelty of mankind is such, that in famine, those that have will keep
for themselves and their dogs, and let the rest of their own species
perish, without so much as a pitying look: and this makes many atheists
in their wants, and does that, without our instigation, which we could
not perswade <i>Job</i> to do, that is, <i>Curse God, and die</i>.</p>

<p>But, my lords, when none of these, our loyal vassals, are abroad, â€™tis
not strange that I am to seek in the cause of this great concourse at
our tribunal; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_307">{307}</a></span> that virtue, for want of reward and due
praise, may not slacken, we will examine to what industrious friend we
owe this unexpected success; wherefore, you minor devils and
under-officers of our court, bring them in order to the bar, and let no
devil of honour, that has past that inferior office of touching the
uncleanness of humanity, defile himself with too near an approach to any
of them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>Here several lacquey-devils and porter-devils, with the rest of

<p class="nind">Speak, criminal, whence thou art? Of what nation, quality, or condition
in the world? And whatâ€™s the happy cause of thy coming hither?</p>

<p><i>Ghost.</i> First, Signor, adjust some points in dispute, which highly
concern the honour of our country, and the decorum of good breeding, and
I shall, for all this noble train that follow me, answer to your
devilshipâ€™s queries. Coming to the confines of your flourishing empire,
we were met by some of the officers of this honourable assembly, who
gave us safe conduct to your royal presence: but just now, entring into
these lifts, confronted us a company of paltry scoundrels, and pressâ€™d
for precedence, swearing, That they were <i>Englishmen</i>, and ought to take
place of all that were damnâ€™d for cuckolds. We urgâ€™d our title in
heraldry, that we ought to take place of all nations, being the
successors of the once masters of the universe; but they were deaf to
reason here, as well as in the world, and one swore <i>d&#8212;me</i>, <i>bl&#8212;d</i> and
<i>z&#8212;ns</i>, another, oaths all round the compass; and in this volly of
mouth-grenadoes, one very demure gentleman pressâ€™d, by <i>Yea</i> and <i>Nay</i>,
that we were in the wrong; and had it not been for this honourable devil
here, thatâ€™s a friend to our nation, we had been wormâ€™d out of our
birth-right by the arse and refuse of the world: <i>Et penitus toto
divisos orbe Britannos</i>, as our noble country-man has it, Dogs shut out
of doors from all the rest of mankind. I therefore appeal to this thrice
excellent senate, and you the <i>right and most reverend doge</i>, to redress
this affront.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_308">{308}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Hey-day? What, has not hell yet brought you to your senses,
that you can think we devils are such sots to trouble our heads about
the ridiculous whims of ceremonious mankind? But since they were so
obstreperous to make a disturbance in hell, they shall be the last
heard: Therefore proceed to the question.</p>

<p><i>Ghost.</i> Anâ€™t please your thrice puissant devilship, noble signor, I was
coming to that point: Therefore, to be brief, (for I hate prolixity) I
am, Sir, an <i>Italian</i> by nation, and a noble-man by quality. My own
vanity, and ill chance, give me a pretty wife, and my honour made me
chuse her of an illustrious house; but she provâ€™d lewd and prodigal, the
natural issue of beauty and high birth; my dotage on her charms hath
bred in me such a fond, blind, uxorious vice (which my countrymen are
seldom guilty of) that I was almost ruinâ€™d before I found I was
betrayâ€™d: but travelling towards <i>Genoa</i>, I met the spark, my pretended
friend, on the road to my dwelling; I seemingly passâ€™d on my way, but in
the night returnâ€™d, unexpected, and surprizâ€™d â€™em all, and, therefore,
as my honour bid me, I murderâ€™d him, and bakâ€™d him in a pye, and
(ingeniously in my revenge) swore she should eat no other food but her
lover: the crust she a while did eat, but one day, having preparâ€™d a
<i>stelleto</i>, at supper she dispatchâ€™d me thus to your thrice noble and
illustrious devilship.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Very well! and worthy thou art of such a punishment, that
couldâ€™st not forgive beauty a gentle slip of that nature thou thyself
hadst so often transgressâ€™d. Speak the next.</p>

<p><i>2 Ghost.</i> I am also an <i>Italian</i>; and observing a gentleman often
ogling my wife, which she did not a little encourage, I sent a <i>bravo</i>
to dispatch him; (for we <i>Italians</i> do not love to look revenge in the
face ourselves) but the rogue of a <i>bravo</i>, won by my wife, and by a
great sum of money of my adversaryâ€™s, comes back to me, and cuts my
throat. And this, most noble signor, is most of our cases; our wives
have given us the casting throw for damnation.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> You, the rest of the malignant train, is this true, that your
wives have sent you hither?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_309">{309}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Yes, yes; we have all had wives.&#8212;&#8212; All the plagues of <i>Egypt</i>
let us undergo, but no wives, we most humbly beseech your most noble
devilship.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Prayers are in vain; transgressions are to be punishâ€™d by the
same way they are committed; nor must you be your own carvers here in
hell, gentlemen. Away with â€™em, down into cuckolds-cave, ten thousand
fathom deeper than the whore-masters, and next the keeping-cullies, <i>and
let each have two wives to torment him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> O wives! wives!</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>They are removed off, and others brought on.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Proceed to the next band.</p>

<p>Say, what were you in the world, and what dear sin brought you to this
place?</p>

<p><i>Spanish Ghost.</i> Great prince of darkness, and lord of the greatest part
of mankind, may it please your catholick majesty, I was, by my worldly
state and condition, a <i>Spanish</i> grandee, of the first magnitude, rich
as fortune and an indulgent prince well could make me, (for your
devilship must know, our king is but a sheep for us to fleece when we
please, which we do in all places, letting his soldiers and inferior
servants starve) happy, â€™till too much success was my undoing; for by
that I gainâ€™d the lady I lovâ€™d, and so in one unhappy word was married.
â€™Tis tedious to repeat the injuries I receivâ€™d from the ungrateful fair,
who, after all, to make room for another, sent me away (like an
<i>Italian</i> as she was) in all my sins, with a poisonous draught.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Is the same your fate, you, the rest of this besotted crew,
that have met with just punishment from one part of yourselves, for
preferring your private grandeur before the service of your king and
honour of your country?</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Yes, yes; thirst of honour and wealth made us cheat the king;
and drew down the judgment of wedlock; and that brought us to this long
home and fiend of matrimony.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with these, and drive â€™em out of their snails pace.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>A tatterâ€™d Ghost comes forward.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Ghost.</i> Just may be their punishment, most noble devil; but why should
I be condemnâ€™d to wincing, who was so far from cheating the king, that I
could never get my due<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_310">{310}</a></span> of him, and being a gentleman born, never did
any thing below my extraction, and have gone without a meal, many a
time, rather than degrade myself to get one? And thoâ€™ I could arrive to
it no other ways, yet kept up my part still in stately walk, and my
wallet, thoâ€™ I had no bread for either, or a shirt to my back.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Since thy own folly made thee marry, â€™tis now too late to
prate, you must away with the rest.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>They are carryâ€™d off, and others brought on.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Bring the next to the bar: declare the cause of your deservâ€™d damnation.
My life onâ€™t these dapper sparks are in for cakes and ale too; the very
air of their faces speaks them cuckolds.</p>

<p><i>French Ghost.</i> Sire, may it please your most victorious majesty,
<i>Vostre Esclaro</i> is a <i>Frenchman</i> by birth, and a leader of the most
christian kingâ€™s most magnanimous forces; and whilst I, with my
commilitones, was reaping lawrels in the field of renown, and engaging
the enemy abroad, my lady wife (as most of our <i>French</i> wives will, for
having once tasted the sweets of love, theyâ€™ll neâ€™er have done â€™till
they have undone us one way or other) my lady wife, I say, was engaging
with a friend at home, who very genteely gave her the pox, which I, at
my return, like a gay cavalier of a husband, receivâ€™d of her as genteely
without rebuke, it being no matter of scandal with us. But
madamoiselleâ€™s pox proving a very <i>virago</i>, gave me damnâ€™d thrust in
<i>quarto</i>, and sent me hither in <i>decimo sexto</i>, <i>monseigneur</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> You, the rest, speak.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> We are all <i>Frenchmen</i>, and therefore you need not doubt the
cause, the pox and our wives, <i>ma foy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with them: theyâ€™ll make a fire by themselves, or will
serve instead of small-coal to kindle others; for they are half burnt
out already. Place â€™em next the <i>Spaniards</i>. The next there speak.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>They are carryâ€™d off, more brought on.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>German Ghost.</i> I am, by nation, a <i>German</i>, and, by damnation, a
husband, a cuckold, or what you please; for I hate to mince the matter
with a long preamble, when a word to the wise is enough.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Very well; you, the rest, speak.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Evâ€™n so, anâ€™t please your imperial devilship;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_311">{311}</a></span> whilst we drank
and fought against the <i>Turks</i>, our wives whorâ€™d with the <i>Christians</i>.
O wives! wives!</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with these into the hottest, for their carcasses are so
soakâ€™d with liquor, that theyâ€™ll put out an ordinary fire. You, the
next, speak.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>They are carryâ€™d off, others brought on.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Dutch Ghost.</i> Gads sacrament, I am a member, or rather two members, of
the <i>Hogen-Mogen</i> common-wealth of <i>Europe</i>. Two members, I say; for I
am a member governed, and a member governing; for the people with us,
and in all such common-wealths, are both subjects and masters, govern
laws, and governâ€™d by the same.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Your countryâ€™s name then is contradiction. Is it not?</p>

<p><i>Ghost.</i> Contradiction to monarchy, thoâ€™ set up by some monarchs to
spite others. But to your question, old tarpaulin: Whilst I was getting
money and drinking punch and brandy, to hearten me for the noble combats
of snick or snee, or some illustrious sea-fight, or some generous
undertaking at the island of <i>Formosa</i>, (for a true <i>Dutchman</i> never
fights without his head full of brandy) my wife made it fly like
<i>sooterkins</i> at home; at last she made me turn bankrupt, and cheat my
creditors, and so dying, I came with a full sail and brisk gale into
your port.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> You, the rest, speak.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> For our wives, O <i>Sooterkin Hagan</i>, our wives, whose
broad-built bulk the boisterous billows bear.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with them into the den of anarchy and confusion, below the
founders of <i>Babel</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang">[<i>They are carryâ€™d off, and abundance of</i> English <i>bands come

<p><i>2 Beauâ€™s Gh.</i> R&#8212;&#8212;t me, <i>Ned</i>, as thou sayâ€™st, I never heard a

<p>I am an <i>Englishman</i>, who, after I had been a notorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_312">{312}</a></span> cuckold, was
perswaded by my wife to fight the man that made me so, and was fairly
killâ€™d for satisfaction, as all this band that follows me were; and we
are damnâ€™d for <i>fools</i> as well as <i>cuckolds</i>.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> â€™Tis true, <i>honour</i> and <i>wedlock</i> have been our ruin.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with them into <i>fools paradise</i>, below the

</p>

<p><i>1 Be. Gh.</i> D&#8212;&#8212; me, <i>Ned</i>, didst ever know such fools as they, that

witness,</p>

<p class="r">

</p>

<p><i>2 Be. Gh.</i> R&#8212;&#8212;t me, <i>Jack</i>, if ever I was of that fighting humour;
nor did I ever fight but once, and then forcâ€™d to it; but my <i>stays</i>
savâ€™d my life, and I wore my glove that was cut in the encounter as long
as â€™twould hang on my hand: therefore, thoâ€™ I knew Sir <i>Roger Allfight</i>
kissâ€™d my <i>wife</i>, yet as long as I could sup at the <i>Rose</i>, and break
the drawerâ€™s head if he made not haste, or brought <i>bad wines</i>, or so,
â€™gad I let him kiss her and welcome.</p>

<p class="r">
[<i>Aside.</i><br />

<p><i>1 Be. Gh.</i> S&#8212;&#8212;k me, <i>Ned</i>, I was always of thy mind, as long as I

of <i>Orangeree</i> or <i>Roderigo</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> D&#8212;&#8212; me if I carâ€™d a rush who rode
in my saddle. But mark that formal coxcomb now going to speak: lord! how
fine a thing it is to be a man of wit, and what a singular figure he
makes! but hark, old grey-beard begins.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Speak you the next.</p>

<p><i>Ghost.</i> I was a man of quality, of the same country; but my fortune
being, in my youth, run out, in <i>France</i> for breeding, and in <i>England</i>
by keeping, I thought in my riper years to retrieve all by marrying a
<i>city heiress</i>; but she had by nature, so much of the mother in her,
that by intriguing and equipage she soon brought me into a worse
condition than before: so that, as my last refuge, I was forcâ€™d to turn
<i>Plotter</i>, and being discoverâ€™d, was loppâ€™d shorter by the head, as all
this honourable tribe that follows me were.</p>

<p><i>Lucif.</i> Away with â€™em. [<i>They are carryâ€™d off, and, as the next are

<p><i>2 Beau. Gh.</i> R&#8212;t me, <i>Jack</i>, <i>vous avez raison</i>: for I always lovâ€™d to
keep myself out of the <i>jeopardy of action</i>: <i>Jack</i>, Iâ€™d talk treason,
or so; sort myself with the disaffected, and blow up the coals of their
<i>discontent</i>, or so: but for <i>engagements, covenants, conditions, and

<p class="r">
[<i>Aside.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>1 Beau. Gh.</i> Z&#8212;ns, <i>Ned</i>, thou and I were always one man; I could rail
at the magistrates, pen a lampoon, or, at least, convey it to <i>Julian</i>,
give penny pies to the mob to make a noise, ridicule the transactions of
the government, and give squinting reflections on the king, that was my

<p>O! what an admirable thing it is to be a man of parts!</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Speak, thou fluttering fool, for the rest of this thy
peacock-gang.</p>

<p><i>L. Flippantâ€™s Ghost.</i> D&#8212;me, Sir, I have been a man of the town, or
rather a man of wit, and have been confessâ€™d a beau, and admitted into
the family of the rakehellonians: and, d&#8212;me, Sir, I think I am much
under that dilemma at present.&#8212;&#8212; I was learnâ€™d in the ingenious art of
dumfounding; a wit I said, dear devil, I was, and it lay as a
gentlemanâ€™s shouâ€™d, most in lewdness and atheism. I married in jest, or
a frolick, which you please; but as I thought a fortune, (got by
cullies) I was made a cuckold in earnest; thoâ€™ that was no grievance to
me, since it only made me in the mode: nor couâ€™d I expect any better,
since I knew she was a whore before I had her; but â€™twas with my
betters, and so I was contented her money should pass currant with me,
where her reputation would not: but sharping was her best quality, and
gaming her greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_314">{314}</a></span> patrimony; and she set up a basset table, and
whilst I was at the groom-porterâ€™s throwing <i>a-main</i>, she would be sure
to set me, at home, a pair of horns. I seldom coming to my apartment,
but I met some cully nobleman or other; but that which was worst, she
still had a knave in her mouth, or an alpue in her tail, that carryâ€™d
away all the gain: whilst I was at <i>Will</i>â€™s coffee-house, fastâ€™ned in
controversy or poetick rhapsodies, though I had neither religion nor
learning, she was sure of me â€™till play-time and then too; for at five,
come, <i>Dick</i>, says I (to a brother of the orange and cravat string)
d&#8212;me, letâ€™s us to the play: r&#8212;t me, says he, â€™tis a dull one: d&#8212;me,
says I, I value not the play, my province lies in the boxes, ogling my
half-crown away, or running from side-box to side-box, to the inviting
incognitoâ€™s in black faces, or else wittily to cry out aloud in the pit,
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Bough</i>, or <i>Boyta</i>, and then be prettily answerâ€™d by the rest of
the wits in the same note, like musical instruments tuned to the same
pitch. And whilst I was thus generously employâ€™d, my consort had her
retreat of quality, to be provided of what I failâ€™d in. From the play to
the <i>Rose</i>, where we drank â€™till four, or break of day; from thence to
bed, where we lay â€™till four or five again, so <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<p><i>1 Beau. Gh.</i> D&#8212;me, <i>Jack</i>, didâ€™st ever hear a sot spoil a good tale in
the telling so?</p>

<p><i>2 Beau. Gh.</i> Z&#8212;ns, <i>Ned</i>, weâ€™re undone throâ€™ this scoundrelâ€™s
ignorance and nonsense: shall I speak?</p>

<p><i>1 Beau. Gh.</i> R&#8212;t me, if thou wilt, thou mayâ€™st: but I am sure I could
make more of it: for thoâ€™ thou art a man of wit, and a good judge of
poetry, and all that, r&#8212;t me, <i>Jack</i>, oratory is thy blind side.</p>

<p><i>2 Beau. Gh.</i> D&#8212;me, Sir, donâ€™t put upon your friends; for have I been
bred at the university, and think myself as good a judge as you or any
man alive: and, Sir, were we out of the court, I believe you would not
thus have abusâ€™d me.</p>

<p><i>1 Beau. Gh.</i> Nay, D&#8212;me, <i>Ned</i>, now thou art unjust to thy friend: r&#8212;t
me, to quarrel forâ€™t, I acknowledgâ€™d thee a man of parts, <i>Ned</i>, and all
that.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Away with the gay sots, and because I have no plagues in hell
equal to their deserts, let them be a torment to one another. Away with
them.</p>

</p>

<p><i>1 Beau. Gh.</i> Well, <i>Ned</i>, shall I speak before it is too late: you may
depend on my excellence in oratory, â€™tis my talent; I never writ
billet-deux in my life, but it prevailâ€™d with the cruel nymph: and do
you think I canâ€™t with the devil? Iâ€™ll perswade him out of his seven
senses, man? d&#8212;me, Iâ€™ll make it appear to him that he is a god, and all
that, man: r&#8212;t me, <i>Ned</i>, be not obstinate.</p>

<p><i>2 Beau. Gh.</i> Z&#8212;ns, Sir, no more of that strain. Sir, youâ€™re a coxcomb.
What doubt my universal parts?</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> You with such a busy face, speak, what are you?</p>

<p><i>Here abundance of Cits, in various dresses, come forward.</i></p>

<p><i>Cit. Ghost.</i> Anâ€™t please your infernal majesty, I was a right
worshipful citizen of <i>London</i>, that famous <i>Metropolis</i> of <i>England</i>,
and I have born all the honourable employments of the same, evâ€™n to
sheriff and lord-mayor: I was long of the court of aldermen, and one of
the chief spokesmen of the common-council: I made speeches, and pennâ€™d
most of the addresses. But â€™tis not for being a cuckold alone, or that I
was feign to cheat so many to maintain my wifeâ€™s pride and luxury, that
I am damnâ€™d with this right worshipful crew here; for those are crimes
common to the rest of our brother-citizens, as well as us; but we were
so mad to marry second wives, and for their sakes turn our children out
of doors, (after we had bred them up in all the ease and luxury of the
age) to seek their fortunes in the wide world, and left our estates to
our wives at our death, who will be sure to bestow them on some silly
hectoring spendthrift bully of <i>Alsatia</i> or other, and let the children,
begot of our own bodies, starve.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Away with that rank gang of fools, as well as knaves, who couâ€™d
so much forget nature and its necessary and known laws, as to cast off
their own off-spring, to give away their substance to those that will
not only misuse it, but contemn the memory of them that were their
benefactors, with so great an injury to nature.</p>

<p><i>2 Cit.</i> May it please your most noble devilship to hear me, before you
give judgment upon us, and I donâ€™t doubt, but I shall seriously, offer
such reasons of our behaviour in that matter, as shall sufficiently move
that ignominy your devilship was pleasâ€™d to cast upon us. First, then,
thoâ€™ it be true, that upon my marriage, I agreed with my second spouse
to turn all my children out of doors, yet I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_316">{316}</a></span> did it not â€™till she or I
had found some cause so to do; for some of them were undutiful, and
others put tricks upon me, (as my good wife said) and others were lewd
and extravagant, and some self-willâ€™d; so that I deserted none of â€™em
without some fault. If they were undutiful, was I to blame to punish â€™em
for it? Or was it my duty to keep and maintain them, after they were of
sufficient bigness to prog for themselves? The birds and beasts take
care of their young no longer, than â€™till they are able to care for
themselves; and why should man be confinâ€™d to more severe laws in that
point than his vassal creatures? I must profess, on the word of a
citizen, that I can see no reason why a man that gets his estate
himself, may not give it away to whom he pleases; and none so and near
deserving, as the wife of oneâ€™s bosom. What thoâ€™ she may have slips, the
witcheries and temptations of love are great to their soft sex; and if
we have been so employâ€™d in getting, that we could not mind that other
business, why should we blame them for easing us by other supplies,
where we wanted power to give them.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Thou hast spoken as much to the purpose, as when in the world
thou used harangue at the choice of a sheriff; and therefore I shall
proceed to a singular punishment for you. Your argument of punishing
your children for their undutifulness, turns here on your own head; for
when they are little, you encourage their impudence: and that is a witty
child with you, that can prate saucily and lewdly before he can read,
and swear and catch the maid by it before seven years old; and then when
you have given them their head without controul, during their childhood
and minority, you punish them for the fruit of that tree which
yourselves have planted, which is in itself the height of injustice; but
on the contrary, you are condemnâ€™d for breaking the laws of your maker,
which you were bred in fear of, and taught to obey; and you that could
punish your own flesh and blood so for nothing, without relenting, have
a just judgment for being punishâ€™d here without mercy. And as for their
being lewd and extravagant, that is no plea for you, since that is the
lesson you have taught â€™em both by example and precept, from the time of
their birth, â€™till their coming to years of understanding; for you let a
taylorâ€™s daughter, with you, go in the garb of the children<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_317">{317}</a></span> of a duke
in the country, and even miss ketch be callâ€™d away from the mob: your
sons must keep their horses, and their whores too, before they know the
use of either; and then you punish them for persevering when they are
better skillâ€™d. And as for the birds and beasts, (examples I think
unworthy to be followâ€™d by a nobler being, or quoted as a precedent)
they are so far excelling you in that point, that they educate their
young in the simple course of nature, not elevating them above whatâ€™s
necessary, nor leaving them, â€™till they have sufficiently inurâ€™d them to
provide for themselves all that nature requires. But just contrary to
the example you quote, you, all the infancy of your children, keep them
from hardship and knowing how to live and provide for themselves, and
then on the sudden cast them out of their nest unfledgâ€™d, without
teaching them to fly. Nor is your proud supposition, that you may
dispose of your own gettings, more pious or justifiable, unless you will
make your selves gods, and claim the propriety of that which you cannot
carry out of the world with you, no more than you brought it in. â€™Twas
heaven that gave success to your endeavours, to provide for those other
blessings it bestowâ€™d upon you, of fine hopeful children; and you were,
in right, but their tenant for life, to improve your substance for their
good. Nor can you in reason imagine any one deserves it better; for
justice and reason both will have it, that you that begot them into the
world without their seeking or desires, to satisfy your own pleasures,
ought to provide all you can for them that you brought thus
involuntarily into the maze of fortune and the treachery of mankind. And
of all in the world, you have the least reason to leave it to a wife,
that not only betrays the rights of your bed, prostituting herself and
your honour to rascals; but shewâ€™d at first so little respect and love
for you, as to desire so unreasonable a thing, that you should cast off
all the bonds of nature, and forsake your own children, which she could
not but love, if she lovâ€™d you: for you know the proverb, <i>love me, love
my dog</i>. Having thus therefore shewn the villainy of your crimes, â€™tis
fit I proceed to your just punishment, for which you are sent hither.
You that have thus more than monstrously prevaricated against nature,
shall want all the benefits of nature; fire you shall have, but not to
give you gentle<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_318">{318}</a></span> warmth from the cold of the season, (as when you livâ€™d
and huggâ€™d yourself in all epicurism, whilst your children starvâ€™d) but
to scorch your wretched consciences; and continual fears of burning your
goods, houses, and writings, shall attend you; to which shall be added
the piercing fire of jealousy, that shall prey upon every part of you;
nor shall you be without the knowledge of your wives transactions on
earth and see how they mourn in sack and claret, and how they marry and
whore before you are cold; how they spend that profusely, which you
scrapâ€™d together to give them, with so much injustice to your poor
orphans, whose injuries shall never let you rest, but with all the fury
of hell for ever torment you worse than <i>Onan</i> or the <i>Sodomites</i>: away
with them, whose villainies raises a horror, even in the prince of hell
and great source of wickedness.</p>

my neighbour <i>Sad-face</i>, and my cousin <i>Goggle</i>, <i>Nahu</i>, <i>Sneakphir</i>,

they not holy sisters, as to the appearance of the flesh, for their
spouses? Yet behold with them, and within the tabernacles of their
mansions, instead of raising up seed to the lord among the chosen and

<p class="c">
<i>The lawyers push forward, and speak very urgently.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Lawyerâ€™s Ghost.</i> Sure, my lord, if the <i>Decorum</i> of any place ought to
be kept, that of a court of judgment ought, and not to let a paultry cit
speak before a man of the robe. But in these popish times, all law is
neglected, and all its honourable professors contemnâ€™d and postponâ€™d.
However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_319">{319}</a></span> my most honourable lord and patron of all that were black, I
shall humbly move this honourable court, that I may at length be heard,
since my cause is of so great import and concern, and in which the
wisdom of this court will be highly interessed, if it should be brought
in <i>Billa vera</i>; and it wouâ€™d too much reflect on the impartiality of
this court of judicature, to be slack in indagating into a cause of this
weight and moment. My lord, before I open, I shall only premise, that I
take this to be the high court of equity. Which granted, I shall begin
to open.</p>

<p>I will confess, that the statutes in <i>Banco Regis</i> may prevail, and
custom in the common-pleas; but humbly presume, with submission to your
lordships, that this being a court of equity, it will give the <a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
devil his due. But, my lord, where a precedent of the like nature may
happen in a case decided by the great council of the nation, I hope it
will not be foreign, if I alledge it here where it has nothing to do.
The case is parallel, as I may say, my lord, considering the
circumstances; that is, in short, <i>Consideratis Considerandis</i>, in
<i>primo Henrici primi</i>, according to my lord <i>Coke</i> upon <i>Littleton</i>; and
if your lordship will let us read, you shall find so many gross errors
in the bill, and the material objections so fully answerâ€™d, and costs,
if not charges and damages. But, my lord, I do humbly suppose, that part
of this bill ought rather to have been put into an indictment, and so
falls not under the cognizance of this court; and that is, my lord, that
we are made <i>Feloâ€™s de se</i>, the causes of our own damnation, by an
instrument callâ€™d a wife, value two-pence. Therefore, my lord, if you
please, let us try it upon a jury in any county your lordship shall
think fit. Thoâ€™, I think, in our case, your lordship may decide it
without farther trouble; for thus I prove the <a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> negative, (hoping
your lordship will let me bring in a writ of error). To deny, my lord,
that we are damnâ€™d, wouâ€™d be perfect nonsense, and against all form of
law; yet that we are damnâ€™d for our wives, I presume, does not follow.
And I will prove, that it does not, so undeniably, to all that have any
profound insight into the law, that I question not but your lordship
will ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_320">{320}</a></span>quiesce <i>Nemine Contradicente</i>; for thoâ€™ it be,</p>

<p>[<i>Aloud</i>] For thoâ€™ I say it be true, that our wives spend a great deal
of money on our clerks, <i>Et cÃ¦tera, quÃ¦ nunc perscribere longum est</i>,
and cuckolded us as often as they pleasâ€™d, in spite of our teeth; and
though I will not deny that they were as profuse as <i>Heliogabalus</i>, or
<i>Caligula</i>, and as proud as <i>Lucifer</i>, (with submission to your
lordship) yet (now comes the paradox) yet, I say, (pray mind this) <i>we
did not get money to maintain their</i> luxury, <i>but they maintainâ€™d their</i>
luxury <i>out of the money that we got</i>: which, I humbly conceive, falls
not under the same predicament, but brings us within the act of <i>Habeas
Corpus</i>, that we may not be carryâ€™d away into the den of ordinary
cuckolds. For, to give your lordship yet a more lively representation of
this matter in question, be pleasâ€™d to reflect on another very pertinent
precedent in my lord <i>Coke</i>, where <i>John-a-Noakes</i> is tenant only for
life, and <i>John-a Stiles</i> tenant in tail&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> Heyday! what, is it <i>Midsummer</i>-moon with mankind? what have we
got here! a cuckold hornmad, prating nonsense, and salving his knavery

take here, where there needs no fee for counsel, nor bribe for judgment.
Away with him and his villainous tribe.</p>

<p><i>Lawyerâ€™s Ghost.</i> Nay, but, my lord, I humbly move your honour, that we
may not be condemnâ€™d, <i>Causa indicta</i>, that is not right or equitable:
wherefore I beseech your lordship to have some regard to me, as I am a
barrister of thirty years standing, and a serjeant of ten, that you
wouâ€™d be pleasâ€™d to reflect, that thoâ€™ I cheated the ignorant, and

with a pair of broad shoulders, and sufficient abilities, and the man of

wives, that they being so obligâ€™d, (according to my text) might prevail

not know from their own country above) with their <i>Ganymedes</i>, from the

my own, I shall confer the office of my deputy on our right reverend and
well-belovâ€™d cousin <i>Belzebub</i>, prince of the <i>Flies</i>; for I am unable

I am resolvâ€™d to trouble myself no more about them. But before we rise,
let proclamation be made of a general play-day and jubilee for all the
lesser and laborious rank of devils, who have been thus long continually
employâ€™d in damning mankind; let them take their ease as long as
matrimony prevails above; for now our business is much better done by

for the good of their country, let them employ their time and talents to
better purpose than formerly, in perswading the easy world against

Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i> and <i>Aaron Smith</i>.</h2>

<p class="nind">SIR <i>Walter</i>. <span class="bigg">H</span>OLD thy impertinent tongue, I say, thou everlasting
babbler, or&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Come, come, we lawyers are not so easily silencâ€™d as you think.
Liberty of speech is one of the eldest branches of <i>magna charta</i>;
therefore I will once more maintain it, before all the world, that the
reign of my late <i>Batavian</i> master, was in every respect equal to that
of the famous <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. Not that isâ€™t worth my while to enter the list with such a
petty-fogging dog as thou art, or the cause in debate admits any manner
of parallel: but since thou hast the impudence to defend so monstrous a
paradox before all this company, inform us what noble things this hero
has performâ€™d, to deserve all that nauseous idle flattery, which hardly
none but <i>Sectarists</i>, <i>Deists</i>, <i>Republicans</i>, and particularly the
rascals of thy kidney, when he was alive, conspirâ€™d to give him.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Why, in the first place, he deliverâ€™d <i>England</i>, then just upon
the brink of being devourâ€™d by arbitrary power and popery. He won the
noble battle of the <i>Boyne</i>, reducâ€™d <i>Ireland</i>, appeasâ€™d the disorders
of <i>Scotland</i>, reapâ€™d a new harvest of glory every campaign in
<i>Flanders</i>, and at last, after an obstinate expensive war, forcâ€™d a
haughty tyrant, who had insulted and bullyâ€™d the whole christian world
for almost forty years, to clap up a peace with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_326">{326}</a></span> upon his own terms
at <i>Ryswick</i>, by which he was obligâ€™d to vomit up numberless provinces
and towns, which he had dishonourably stollen from their true
proprietors.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. And as for his personal qualities, what have you to say of
them?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Whether you behold him at home or abroad, in the cabinet or the
field; in fine, whether you consider him as a king, a general, a
statesman, a husband, or a master, youâ€™ll find his character uniformly
bright in all these relative stations: affectionate to his queen,
merciful to his subjects, liberal to his servants, careful of his
soldiers, and providing, by his great wisdom, against all future
contingencies that might hereafter disturb the tranquillity of <i>Europe</i>.
But as for his munificence to his servants and favourities, I may
venture to say, that few princes in history ever went so far as he.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. This last clause is not so great a commendation to him as
you imagine.&#8212;Well, and is this all, for I wouâ€™d not willingly interrupt
you, â€™till you have gone the full length of your panegyrick?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> â€™Tis all I think needful to say upon the occasion, and enough,
in my opinion, to establish his reputation to to all succeeding ages.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. Let us carefully examine the several particulars; and when
we have so done, we shall be able to determine on what side the truth
lies&#8212;<i>Imprimis</i>, you tell me he deliverâ€™d <i>England</i> from tyranny and
popish superstition: but was there no other way of accomplishing his
deliverance, but by sending a certain relation to grass, and wounding
the monarchy in so tender a part, which had sufferâ€™d so terribly in the
late unnatural rebellion of 41? If what one of the ancient fathers says,
be true, that the whole world is not worth the saving, at the expence of
a single lye, surely <i>Great Britain</i>, which makes so small a part of the
universe, hardly deservâ€™d to be deliverâ€™d from an imaginary ruin with so
much perjury, infidelity, and ingratitude. Besides, he solemnly
protested in his declaration, that he had no intention to make himself
king, yet he excercisâ€™d the regal power the very moment he landed: so
that unless there had been a crown in the case, I am afraid he would
hardly have crossâ€™d the water to rescue the church of <i>England</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_327">{327}</a></span></p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> This is indeed what his enemies and some envious people have
objected to him.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. Nothing of that can be laid to my charge, who was never
known to your hero either <i>Beneficio</i> or <i>Injuria</i>; but as I still
preserve an invincible affection for my native country, my zeal for the
welfare of that, makes me assume this freedom. To be plain with you
then, I can hardly believe he had any extraordinary concern for the
prosperity of <i>England</i>, upon whom he threw the greatest burden of the
war; whose troops he sufferâ€™d to fight without their pay, in <i>Flanders</i>,
at the same time when a parcel of unworthy foreigners had store of gold
and silver in their pockets. Neither can any man perswade me he had the
least affection for the royal family, from which he was descended, who
sufferâ€™d such numberless invectives and libels to be publishâ€™d against
his royal grandfather, both his uncles, and, in short, the whole family
of the <i>Stuarts</i>, yet never callâ€™d any of the authors or printers to an
account forâ€™t during the whole course of his reign.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Aye, but a hero, you know, has other business to mind, than the
<i>bagatelles</i> of the press.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. And yet this hero could condescend to mind these
<i>bagatelles</i>, as you call them, with a witness, whenever they were
levellâ€™d against himself or his favourites. But to proceed,&#8212;can any one
in his senses believe, that this deliverer ever set the monarchy and
true constitution of <i>England</i> to heart, under whose reign all the
democratical treatises, both of this and the last age, were not only
publishâ€™d with impunity, but the abettors of such villainous doctrine,
thought the only persons that were in the true interest of the nation,
and deserving to be preferrâ€™d? Was <i>England</i> so utterly destitute of
able generals, that a regicide, proscribâ€™d by act of parliament, must be
sent for over to head our forces in <i>Ireland</i>?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Youâ€™ll never leave off harping upon this string.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. And lastly, have we not very violent reasons to suspect,
that he never had any true hearty concern for the protestant interest,
whatever he pretended to the contrary, who so notoriously sacrificâ€™d it
at the treaty of <i>Ryswick</i>; who, to enable him to carry on the late
revolution against his uncle and father-in-law, enterâ€™d into a league;
one of the first articles of which, was, to oblige<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_328">{328}</a></span> the king of <i>France</i>
to do justice to the usurpations of the <i>Roman</i> see? And lastly, who, if
he had no aversion, had certainly no affection for the church of
<i>England</i>, the support, as well as ornament of the whole reformation,
which evidently appearâ€™d by his bestowing its best preferments upon
<i>illos quos pingere nola</i>, a sett of moderate lukewarm gentlemen, that
were willing (good men) to throw up the constitution, whenever their
enemies should ask them the question. What shall I say of others, that
were advancâ€™d for no other merit, but because they had been justly
punishâ€™d in former reigns for their seditious practices, or descended
from <i>Oliverian</i> parents; or lastly, because they held antimonarchical
and antihierarchical doctrine, both in pulpit and press, which they
honestly callâ€™d free-thinking?</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Nay, this is mere calumny; for can any thing but the blackest
envy presume: to attack him upon the score of religion?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. For once Iâ€™ll spare his religion, yet â€™tis certain his
ministers had not the least tincture of it. To the eternal honour of his
reign, be it observâ€™d, all the <i>Socinian</i> treatises that stole into the
world in the late accursed times of licentiousness and disorder, were
fairly reprinted, and these, together with the modern improvements of
<i>Deism</i>, fold in the face of the sun, without the least check or
discountenance from any at the helm: â€™twas come to that pitch at last,
that a man might better call the divinity of our Saviour into question,
than the legality of that revolution; and safer insult the ashes of king
<i>James</i> the 1st, <i>Charles the martyr</i>, and the whole royal line, than
attack such a lewâ€™d, perjurâ€™d, infamous scoundrel as <i>Oates</i>. â€™Tis a
general maxim, that the court always steers its course <i>ad Exemplum
CÃ¦saris</i>; and that a shrewd guess may be made of a princeâ€™s morals, by
those of his ministers. If this observation holds good, a man would find
himself strangely tempted to say some rash things of your monarch, which
good manners and decency oblige me to pass over in silence.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> But still you say nothing of <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. Far be it from me to do detract in the least from any
manâ€™s actions: But this, I think, I may affirm, without the least
suspicion of malice, that the exploit of the <i>Boyne</i>, every thing
considerâ€™d, is not al<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_329">{329}</a></span>together so miraculous as his flattering divines
and courtiers would represent it; for, after all, where was the wonder,
that a well-disciplinâ€™d regular army should defeat an unfortunate
dispirited monarch, with none but a few raw, unpractisâ€™d, naked troops
about him? and then his giving the forfeited estates there to his
minions, in open contradiction to what he had promised the parliament,
does not seem to argue so great a concern for keeping his word. As for
<i>Scotland</i>, the subversion of episcopacy, and murder of the
<i>Glencow-men</i>, (not to mention the perpetuating of the convention,
during his whole reign, and by that means depriving the country of
electing proper members) will, I believe, look so frightful in future
story, that few of your heroeâ€™s flatterers will mention the
administration of that kingdom to his credit.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Well then, but <i>Fanders</i>?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. I thank you for reminding me of it. I am of opinion then,
that, bating <i>Namure</i>, he might have put all the glorious harvests he
yearly reapâ€™d there, into his eye, and not have prejudicâ€™d his royal
sight in the least. However, as I know full well what a mighty advantage
one powerful prince, that commands by his own single authority, has over
a many-headed confederacy, where all are commanders I scorn to insist
upon this point. For this reason I will not enumerate, nor enlarge upon
the constant ill success that everlastingly attended him in <i>Flanders</i>,
but come to the peace of <i>Ryswick</i>, which was his own proper act and
deed. And here â€™tis worth our observing, that by his leaving the poor
emperor in the lurch, the city of <i>Strasburg</i> unluckily continuâ€™d in the
<i>French</i> hands; and that either out of want of politicks or a zeal for
their religion, he made no stipulations for the <i>German Protestants</i>,
nor took the least care to have them restorâ€™d to those churches, of
which they had been unjustly dispossessâ€™d in the war.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> Well, but necessity, you know, may make a man sometimes act
contrary to his inclination.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. Why then did his parasites give out, That he was the
controller of the peace, and forcâ€™d the <i>French</i> king to accept of it
upon his own terms.&#8212;But not to mention a thousand other things that
might be said upon this occasion, for I begin to grow weary of the
subject, to stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_330">{330}</a></span> my mouth for good and all, and convince thee how far
superior in all the arts of governing the immortal <i>Elizabeth</i> was to
thy <i>taciturn Hero</i>, Iâ€™ll first give thee a short sketch of her golden
reign, and afterwards honestly and impartially shew thee a prospect of
the other:</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i> With all my heart, proceed.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Walter</i>. As my mistress had a true <i>English</i> heart, and made the
prosperity of her people the only business of her life, she sufferâ€™d
none of her ministers to crave to themselves extravagant fortunes out of
the publick purse. Thoâ€™ foreigners flockâ€™d into her dominions as a
certain asylum, yet she never encouragâ€™d them to the detriment of her
native subjects, nor imployâ€™d them in foreign embassies, nor admitted
them into her councils: her affairs being managâ€™d with equal prudence
and integrity, and encouragements properly distributed, no wonder she
was so fortunate in all her attempts. Thus we find she supported the
protestants in <i>France</i> against the oppression of the <i>Guises</i>, and so
well assisted the <i>Dutch</i> in the infancy of their republick, that
<i>Philip</i> II of <i>Spain</i>, with all his forces, was not able to reduce
them. She was so far from bellowing her royal favours upon the
sectaries, that she suppressâ€™d their growing insolence with wholesome
laws, and was as careful to see them put in Execution. She could display
all her fatherâ€™s magnificence, when there was a proper occasion to exert
it; at other times, she observâ€™d a strict parsimony, equally
advantageous to her own subjects, and easy to herself. The establishâ€™d
church flourishâ€™d so well under her auspicious administration, that
<i>England</i> never saw so glorious a constellation of reverend bishops and
learned divines, as in her reign. She retrieved the honour of the
<i>Exchequer</i>, and managâ€™d her payments so wisely, that her people thought
their money as safe in her coffers as in their own.&#8212;&#8212; Now, your
delivererâ€™s reign was the exact reverse of this happy scene. Schism and
faction advancâ€™d, hypocrisy and dulness, under the disguise of
reformation, promoted to the highest honours, deism propagated, the true
genuine sons of the church discouragâ€™d, foreigners admitted into our
private councils, trade neglected, our narrow seas daily insulted, the
publick impoverishâ€™d, the treasury exhausted and pillagâ€™d by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_331">{331}</a></span> insatiable
cormorants, the reputation of our arms decayâ€™d and sunk, the sea-man
starvâ€™d, the soldiers paid with paper; in short, nothing but ill
management and poverty at home, and infamy abroad.&#8212;&#8212; And this I think
is sufficient to shew you, that you were mightily mistaken, when you
comparâ€™d you know who to the immortal <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
